that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which CIA CIA delivered literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if it sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not waste the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Am@@ end@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courage@@ ous they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked up at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cra@@ cks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of fail@@ ing and cra@@ cking to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telephone numbers secret , &quot;
&quot; like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit rating , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and cra@@ cks alleged source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in his lawyer , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government ranks too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology is allowed to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in h@@ ind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet been published as a cra@@ p wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to take off@@ ences , and it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers . &quot;
or the next environmental officer who al@@ erts alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider who war@@ ns us in front of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
also there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s let@@ ter@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next un@@ covered documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to be we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this happen to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and un@@ covering for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people all appear conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent American who were present in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that some U.S. states need less information to give less information to form a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers are allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really shock@@ ed us that all except for a lawyer our investig@@ ator made suggestions , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single attorney who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wrapped in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we must change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules in order to make these types of behaviour difficult .
&quot; this may sound very sad , as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing could ever have changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a secure optim@@ ist , I quite see that some changes have begun . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen demonstrations towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
&quot; we need managers in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a res@@ ale sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my things .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; um , how ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at night , I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling , and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such fear that I got out of bed , sli@@ pping ti@@ to@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people , who were sold to me as strangers in childhood , were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my ro@@ ommate is moving out and the rent is raised . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese ham mo@@ ckers ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and falling into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people share publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
on the Internet they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you focus on things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to make sure that you unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locking mobile phone to your left @-@ facing neighbour .
&quot; this quiet approach to panic , which you now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time . &quot;
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel when they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is di@@ pping for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told , where did he come from , how to be his dog or his children ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked cell phones !
how would you feel if you had to hand over your phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens confidence decis@@ i@@ vely .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to hand out negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation per@@ si@@ sts simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are priced from . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds upon the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; with what we had not expected , the great deal of people who were more than willing to cast these pre@@ judi@@ ces was . &quot;
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
one can recognize three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a requirement that had not been un@@ covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is going very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who dis@@ allowed parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million spent over@@ nights had only one fraction ever a problem . &quot;
for men trust one another to justice .
&quot; when trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgement :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay will run away . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled over this term , I wonder@@ ed : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but now just to call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , it &apos;s easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what would be if at any place that one would visit , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a tavern tour of which one has never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking of a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the shared share ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships rather than sol@@ itude and isolation .
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces that the government belonged to . &quot;
&quot; students who were looking for a stay , were now offered . &quot;
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started .
&quot; in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest with a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also a lot of hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has our work right now ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome pre@@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I think it amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
absolutely stunning .
every time I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da drive past me .
we know of course that design can not solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in check @-@ in at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to vote .
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual human , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I was 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only passi@@ vely accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and eventually believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion that deep@@ ened itself with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that somebody perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; Eil@@ ean &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Near East ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... , &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others from one citizen turned me into a susp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate course . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
we moved this night into our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well @-@ lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Do not dec@@ eive you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims congreg@@ ate for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings watched : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims , wander@@ ing and struck . &quot;
there were really sur@@ charges on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have paid off the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the US body .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is observed only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
= = = &gt; Fu@@ ji@@ war@@ a
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ as . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques become more secure ?
&quot; maybe a few parking spaces will be released , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people &apos;s other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in Washington , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent Radi@@ c@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a non@@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination by recogni@@ zing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
= = = &gt; Fu@@ ji@@ war@@ a
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if one casts a glance at her , she does not drive what she read in her &quot; Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because they were in front of the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and made sense of their rage , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to solve a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect the normal American ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we are more likely to accept an author@@ it@@ arian system of government , con@@ formance and pre@@ ju@@ dice . &quot;
&quot; one study shows that if you submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they agreed to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims pushed upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two elections .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to hollow the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
how to deal with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
&quot; in order to assign collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most gra@@ cious person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did my brother become such a sav@@ our@@ y young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered them , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he enjoyed De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and pulled out my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I have broken together . &quot;
these people were there because they had had courage and compassion Pan@@ ik and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who may pret@@ end that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , work in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as custom@@ ary as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at the Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest ever study on Muslims all over the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people appear like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a b@@ ast@@ ler platform is about to become a multi @-@ billion dollar store .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ parcel delivery inv@@ aded our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air @-@ devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ regul@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the boundaries of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively known where the mobile objects are located in space . &quot;
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a fli@@ cker trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the plane does not matter in which position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which join to hurt you . &quot;
decades ago trained pilot operated air@@ planes could fly that only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies are working with just one . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ served flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse rods , no additional actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and move around in space everywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it correctly . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right when I see all is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the monster is an exercise in in@@ suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is not symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at it .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must become extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates c@@ lock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , al@@ beit constra@@ ined . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration studies synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took custom@@ ary micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , the particularly safe machine would like to become a flying lamp screen . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the impact of this technology . &quot;
for types like us is the reward in the development and creation act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , and thus converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of all of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events in the first place .
it was 1.3 billion years ago that a multi @-@ cell life on earth was created .
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group decided to build a particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are about by colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which dramatically improved the detection performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent issues . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes penet@@ rated through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically that was the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cri@@ mp@@ ing in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and perfor@@ ated into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers often conduct a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance in courses of rel@@ ativity theory . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed upon the sur@@ ge of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott says , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
in tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by observing changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound we can hear the universe literally .
&quot; listening to the grav@@ itation can tell us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has occupied himself very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just run : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies rotate very quickly , you hear the same p@@ act with an additional key change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu . &quot;
it is a kind of movement wor@@ ding embos@@ sed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- This is the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which can rotate approximately as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let us consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding importance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe , as it never existed before . &quot;
on this road we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible .
&quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes are happening in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through since these op@@ aque are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own offspring . &quot;
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there are all things that we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we had not expected . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o watching them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work , so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different point of view on the events of space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and p@@ ant@@ ries of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a definite yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected article . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Em@@ erson . and Em@@ erson , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; cookies , &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from that time I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am an author . I think things out , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce TV .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days by four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programmes , 70 hours TV , three programmes at the same time : 24 episodes : horror , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running after each other on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ scene . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing that ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you , that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I say about work so you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and fan@@ ta@@ sies , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is as I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , you bear a high tone , get a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and sensible . and the best part is that sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is well underway .
&quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums , that I am writing about writing that writing me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , you do it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum@@ ming -- when I began with television production when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t look different to size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what you call sums .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more crowded boundaries , the more work there is , the more things happen at the same time , the more I write history , the more my expectations are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the tot@@ als stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ drive . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um@@ my is a single work .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ erson says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ an .
they are baby ti@@ anas .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums ceased . &quot;
the sum of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums were not returned .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same tit@@ an work , 15 hours @-@ days , thoroughly worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
date : 06 / 13 / 2009 Size :
&quot; everything was gray , I just didn &apos;t have any fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz was me .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; how@@ l you , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; you know you do it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother to be a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you already knew the sums , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , as two things will be aware of : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; cookies . &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; cookies . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and smo@@ ker my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and meet her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax p@@ encils and the song in which it comes to release or whatever the girl lets go into &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let us remain in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the bu@@ zz , the working @-@ sum , the title thumb , that &apos;s just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on pleasure .
true sums depend on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be imposed , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; true sums are God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as easy as working .
the truth hur@@ ts
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer working at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , for what a person pre@@ fers to be rather than being home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we ro@@ am in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
&quot; you can also do it ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and when my teen@@ age @-@ daughter talk to me for 15 minutes , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more it does not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can get up for 15 minutes , even in a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes on the play !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no dist@@ ra@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that children make ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the sums , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure .
&quot; to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it yourself .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll reti@@ re and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to out@@ perform myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the sum@@ ming of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ ing to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium playing the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , trem@@ bling , bare and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am an author . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , that means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after an auto accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self healing . &quot;
&quot; after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures .
&quot; surely , they have heard of one of the best known &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; thereby , one im@@ planted an electro@@ de deeply in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s who suffered under intense trem@@ or and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with cran@@ ium @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
&quot; you have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain oscill@@ ates and the skull pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; to do this , you sometimes need to remove a portion of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to quite small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to flour@@ ish . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it created Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they remain to us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot;
but one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and they subsequently highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the final step , we stri@@ cken them at the reception table of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we ro@@ b these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we treat the same cells in weak@@ ened brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we ro@@ uted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a violation and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we in vitro , dy@@ e in culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor vehicle range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it happened in humans , it recovered spontane@@ ously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey who spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we ple@@ aded the cells : the same monkey , two months after implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you this was also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you must prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ge@@ ography .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- will not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought it could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy our societies are bri@@ mm@@ ing , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg who th@@ rows his long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the &quot; &quot; Schul@@ den@@ berg &quot; , &quot; &quot;
but only a few recognise his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is too anx@@ ious to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which you could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail@@ ways , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ame the stock exchanges and lift up real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin tops , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , feared the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally bring about the circumstances leading to the fact that the body is killing him .
that is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; its very wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy closed too many of course --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but also more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co@@ determination with the same vote weigh@@ ting on issues of public concerns . &quot;
ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which sh@@ ines very bri@@ ghtly , it is burned out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- was a democratic free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by shifting the economy slowly and de@@ compos@@ ing it . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because you can be in the government today and yet not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ s the animals from which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has chann@@ elled the policy so far that it cuts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political assets are de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest in the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin tops , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , like in Ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor recover only through a miracle a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ shing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes automation the twin peaks higher , the waste more prosper@@ ous , and social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentation . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced .
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and the human beings put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it look like to have this &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in brief . &quot;
&quot; in the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital is following you from a job to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all revenues come from capital and from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those which the companies belong , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no big gaps between investment and labour , no big gaps between investment and labour , and ultimately no rising twin tops . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- let us call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; into units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have it , in particular against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time the secretary in which she pre@@ fers privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we jointly decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do we do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next one we are witness@@ ing is not only dest@@ abili@@ zing our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant . &quot;
&quot; like Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of them play , -- in the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic free zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error that is historically considered .
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was very scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , to pret@@ end to pret@@ end to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century , it sm@@ ells mighty in hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
&quot; BG : I &apos;m sure , that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year . &quot;
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive destruction line went through the Eurozone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the euro@@ zone , have continued to choose den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to preserve an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be a time delay , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister , who after 6 months in office , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he did not make a mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the ex@@ ams that were passing through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that for 5 years they had gone through a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed on us this policy , stood : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive dialogue of the talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the liber@@ ated centri@@ sts will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to hit the road of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you will be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; of Roy Price most have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an iso @-@ term and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of that curve . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website . the rating runs from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows this score is received .
&quot; will your show valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ted , where , after you &apos;ve looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more from these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t enth@@ use them . &quot;
so he must make sure he is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online , where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon does things out for nothing , you get too , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look at once again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide what show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and from it the answer follows , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show with data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the pieces together they entered a carriage and decided not to make a sit@@ com more than four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is this ?
because logic states that this should work in everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time where we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in jail . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not . &quot;
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will decide whether a person will be good or bad .
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis is , in spite of the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . that is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data of experienced firms are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can pre@@ dict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked faul@@ t@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped functioning , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- in the workplace , in the case of law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful choices based on data and not successful decisions .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you disman@@ tle this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they otherwise would not have been able to do . but deciding how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
but Amazon did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; They say the data . &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it &apos;s also called the Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a demo demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in h@@ ind@@ sight on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you do and take risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
