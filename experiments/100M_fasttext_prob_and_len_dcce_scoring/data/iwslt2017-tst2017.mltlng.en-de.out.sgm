<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which CIA CIA delivered literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if it sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not waste the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked up at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they stated for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and cracking to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"so the investigators, without his consent, kept his telephone numbers secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"like its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit rating, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and cracks alleged source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower in his lawyer, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government ranks too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology is allowed to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that has not yet been published as a crap wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it's up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to take offences, and it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers."</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental officer who alerts alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider who warns us in front of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness about an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness about an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad's letterbox firms in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and uncovering for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people all appear confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent American who were present in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle behind which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that some U.S. states need less information to give less information to form a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers are allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator turned out to be an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really shocked us that all except for a lawyer our investigator made suggestions, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single attorney who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single top politician, wrapped in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we must change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to make these types of behaviour difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very sad, as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing could ever have changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a secure optimist, I quite see that some changes have begun."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen demonstrations towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need managers in the economy who stand up and say," "Intransparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a resale sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "um, how?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I lay in bed, I gazed at the ceiling, and thought," "Oh man!"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I got out of bed, slipping titoes to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people, who were sold to me as strangers in childhood, were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is moving out and the rent is raised."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can create it, to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese ham mockers tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and falling into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website where people share publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type rooms whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you focus on things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to make sure that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocking mobile phone to your left-facing neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quiet approach to panic, which you now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most guests feel when they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is dipping for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told, where did he come from, how to be his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked cell phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand over your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens confidence decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to hand out negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if one has more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation persists similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are priced from."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, such as" "Hi!" "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I make holiday with my family." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds upon the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we had not expected, the great deal of people who were more than willing to cast these prejudices was."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a requirement that had not been uncovered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is going very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who disallowed parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million spent overnights had only one fraction ever a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust one another to justice.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, wonderful things can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay will run away."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled over this term, I wondered:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just to call" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it's easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be if at any place that one would visit, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a tavern tour of which one has never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking of a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the shared share?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships rather than solitude and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces that the government belonged to."</seg>
<seg id="240">"students who were looking for a stay, were now offered."</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started.</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest with a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a lot of hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our work right now?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome prerooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think it amazingly,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Absolutely stunning.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about it when a red Mazda drive past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in check-in at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull-fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to vote.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual human, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I was 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and eventually believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion that deepened itself with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that somebody perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "Eilean". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Near East..."... "..." "jihad...,"... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others from one citizen turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate course."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I drove silently -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved this night into our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," Be alert, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well-lighted areas, "" Do not deceive you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims congregate for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings watched:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims, wandering and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surcharges on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have paid off the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is observed only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">= = = &gt; Fujiwara</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first helpers and Olympias."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques become more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe a few parking spaces will be released, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people's other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in Washington, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent Radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a nonviolent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination by recognizing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">= = = &gt; Fujiwara</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one casts a glance at her, she does not drive what she read in her" Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because they were in front of the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and made sense of their rage, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised to solve a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect the normal American?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are more likely to accept an authoritarian system of government, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows that if you submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they agreed to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood against Muslims pushed upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to hollow the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">How to deal with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"in order to assign collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most gracious person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my brother become such a savoury young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He enjoyed Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanaticism can be fatal, but also deadly."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and pulled out my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at that moment, I have broken together."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had had courage and compassion Panik and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a bastler platform is about to become a multi-billion dollar store.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-parcel delivery invaded our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, air-devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-regulable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the boundaries of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in space."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flicker trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the plane does not matter in which position the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask basic abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which join to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilot operated airplanes could fly that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies are working with just one."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-served flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rods, no additional actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and move around in space everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right when I see all is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monster is an exercise in insufficiency, this machine is here, the omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must become extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit constrained."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studies synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took customary micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Broadway, the particularly safe machine would like to become a flying lamp screen."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and creation act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, wise creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, and thus converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of all of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">It was 1.3 billion years ago that a multi-cell life on earth was created.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago a group decided to build a particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a giant laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are about by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which dramatically improved the detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent issues."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes penetrated through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically that was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crimping in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and perforated into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers often conduct a really albering dance in courses of relativity theory."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed upon the surge of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of a atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott says, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by observing changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has occupied himself very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just run: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies rotate very quickly, you hear the same pact with an additional key change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu."</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement wording embossed in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- This is the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which can rotate approximately as quickly as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe, as it never existed before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in space, we can't see -- practically or basically -- not."</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super novae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes are happening in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own offspring."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we had not expected."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo watching them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work, so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us a completely different point of view on the events of space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and pantries of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year, I would say" "Yes" "that I was afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "Yes". ""</seg>

<seg id="568">"but there was a definite yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected article. it started with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" cookies, ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from that time I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" -say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am an author. I think things out, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days by four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programmes, 70 hours TV, three programmes at the same time: 24 episodes: horror, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I created myself, and not only produced, so still obscene. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, when the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you, that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I say about work so you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not going to dream about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"in such a way, you bear a high tone, get a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and sensible. and the best part is that sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is well underway.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums, that I am writing about writing that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't get me wrong, you do it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the summing -- when I began with television production when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you can't look different to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more crowded boundaries, the more work there is, the more things happen at the same time, the more I write history, the more my expectations are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overdrive."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mummy is a single work.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titan.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby tianas.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sum of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums were not returned.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same titan work, 15 hours-days, thoroughly worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">Date: 06 / 13 / 2009 Size:</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just didn't have any fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "howl you, stupid author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"you know you do it, you're doing what you're doing to be a teacher, a banker, a mother to be a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you already knew the sums, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late, and she says," Mum, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will say no, as two things will be aware of:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" cookies. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "cookies."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and smoker my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mum, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and meet her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax pencils and the song in which it comes to release or whatever the girl lets go into" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no mystery. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working-sum, the title thumb, that's just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">True sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be imposed, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums are God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as easy as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, for what a person prefers to be rather than being home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we roam in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crush soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can also do it! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you."</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you think me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teenage-daughter talk to me for 15 minutes, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more it does not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can get up for 15 minutes, even in a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that children make ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the sums, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="759">"to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'll retire and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to outperform myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The summing of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a titanium playing the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I create the marathon I run, the troops, the screens, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right buzz: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, trembling, bare and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am an author. I think things out, I awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, that means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after an auto accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely, they have heard of one of the best known" "deep brain stimulation". "thereby, one implanted an electrode deeply in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered under intense tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with cranium-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine that in skull-brain traumas, the brain oscillates and the skull pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, you sometimes need to remove a portion of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to quite small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it created Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology, that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the final step, we stricken them at the reception table of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we rob these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we treat the same cells in weakened brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we routed the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplantiated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we in vitro, dye in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor vehicle range in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it happened in humans, it recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we pleaded the cells: the same monkey, two months after implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you this was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first of all, you must prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable geography.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- will not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought it could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would abolish if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"because without democracy our societies are brimming, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin-summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg who throws his long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the" "Schuldenberg", ""</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which you could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railways, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflame the stock exchanges and lift up real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin tops, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, feared the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances leading to the fact that the body is killing him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its very wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenic democracy closed too many of course --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of athenic democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about the athenic democracy was and is that they involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but also more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political codetermination with the same vote weighting on issues of public concerns."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenic democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very brightly, it is burned out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- was a democratic free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by shifting the economy slowly and decomposing it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you can be in the government today and yet not in power, because the power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustains the animals from which they feed, decimated, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has channelled the policy so far that it cuts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political assets are devalued, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest in the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "of democracy, the higher the twin tops, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and economy, and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, like in Ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor recover only through a miracle a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes automation the twin peaks higher, the waste more prosperous, and social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy which makes the film" matrix "appear as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" matrix, "in which machines serve human beings and the human beings put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it look like to have this" "Star Trek" "utopia instead of the" "Matrix" "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in brief."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital is following you from a job to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all revenues come from capital and from revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those which the companies belong, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no big gaps between investment and labour, no big gaps between investment and labour, and ultimately no rising twin tops."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- let us call it" the Cosmos, "into units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have it, in particular against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time the secretary in which she prefers privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we jointly decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... Do we do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers is called a" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next one we are witnessing is not only destabilizing our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of them play, -- in the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that is an error that is historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, to pretend to pretend to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, it smells mighty in hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"BG: I'm sure, that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive destruction line went through the Eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the eurozone, have continued to choose denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to preserve an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be a time delay, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister, who after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, claims he did not make a mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the exams that were passing through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that for 5 years they had gone through a catastrophic program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed on us this policy, stood:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive dialogue of the talks, you seem to be still pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the liberated centrists will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to hit the road of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"of Roy Price most have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an iso-term and describes himself on Twitter as" Films, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought branch."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of that curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website. the rating runs from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows this score is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that addicted, where, after you've looked at a relay, your brain asks:" where are there more from these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what's going on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't care about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to sign" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the medium output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't enthuse them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online, where they can watch everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon does things out for nothing, you get too, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look at once again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and from it the answer follows, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show with data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always searching for a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the pieces together they entered a carriage and decided not to make a sitcom more than four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data-sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic states that this should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is something terrifying because we live in a time where we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will decide whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis is, in spite of the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of experienced firms are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked faultlessly, year by year, until it suddenly stopped functioning,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this again was a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- in the workplace, in the case of law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people use ununimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful choices based on data and not successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you dismantle this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful, because they used data and mind, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they otherwise would not have been able to do. but deciding how to take all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards "is not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">But Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say," They say the data. ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called the Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in hindsight on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays to make decisions, an expert in what you do and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
