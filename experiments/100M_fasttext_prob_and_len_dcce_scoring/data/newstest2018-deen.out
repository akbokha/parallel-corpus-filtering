Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
a cryp@@ t chapel where it is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn ( S @-@ Bahn ) tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everybody who had to get up@@ set because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Ba@@ war@@ ia At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not immediately recognised as such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard , detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ sus blades , were incorporated into cities and communities . &quot;
this originated according to the Bavarian survey administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originates from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was the neighbours today who created the idea of an area @-@ covering Bavarian map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration . &quot;
the judgment sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of former / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; it was 21 years after the map was created , thus in 1877 as a district of Munich . &quot;
&quot; today , sub @-@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming out a small @-@ piece map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ in hand numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ um@@ ption &quot; &quot; from which the plots were derived . &quot;
&quot; there are small plots there , not farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands out north of sub@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ place of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete sc@@ aff@@ olds . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; lying on the air &quot; &quot; but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse one once opened people with del@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circuit @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also prohibited the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Clinic Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , youth in the Munich @-@ based Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet . &quot;
the Order acquired the complex of buildings in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East is located west , east of residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was erected in architectural enti@@ t@@ lement to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War with bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the department was named &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a large one remained until today - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Mari@@ en@@ hof , where this day the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second subur@@ ban railway line will take place . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ our@@ ful has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i on the basis of the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into effect until 28 August 2017 , invites African travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents have recently occurred throughout the country and be noted here , &quot; says the Group . &quot;
&quot; a recent law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , which disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ately to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to publish travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , which happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are crushed or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of any crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which shows that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring it to deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i signed 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI hate crime report that ranks the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th position of the country . &quot;
travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona , after the states have adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement agencies commit to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further road @-@ pro@@ filed by the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ous project is elementary &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U parliam@@ ent@@ arians Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac made a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ wing cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ urban association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommod@@ ated in five apartments of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative dis@@ semination route for the milk of his cows , as Schwen@@ n@@ mann . &quot;
only region@@ als come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ous project &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; fundamental &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit in such steep areas .
&quot; the gr@@ ass@@ land area is responsible for a lot of work , a lot must be worked with the Pul@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here struggling with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser even if he does not lead organic farm . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ est@@ ation of the land could be dra@@ ined for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; thus , the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted to leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers left 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women .
&quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm , &quot; &quot; Here , best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape History Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the government to promote pasture f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the requirement is the presence of a conveyor set marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be tractor @-@ mach@@ in@@ able ( slope slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ est@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man &apos;s electric fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants is currently underway with 24 pitches , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump Regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the president for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of land@@ owners and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have paid him if he had done it .
&quot; but it took its meaning , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta outlined : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here for a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , which long for you to breathe freely , / the el@@ ending apost@@ asy of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; w@@ ret@@ ched waste &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot;
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical portra@@ yal .
&quot; Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the significance of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not a drawer , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives to bring the American flame to the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh found quite unusual here on something .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ ending but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch should not illumin@@ ate the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship Lead will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special is developed &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will keep it on until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected captain of the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , which E@@ ili@@ d@@ h totally natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les in their fifth world champion@@ ships , says that it is &quot; &quot; unbelievable &quot; &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir carries on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champion@@ ships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; the team @-@ captain says they are &quot; &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the medals and at the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honour , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me , it makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
block@@ ade of Cri@@ tics via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the n@@ atives of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ ou@@ ted in criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led as sheep for slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land , governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who vo@@ iced their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained that this was the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary h@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his page .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is designated as official and paid by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound . &quot;
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented cour@@ te@@ ously that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take place on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective bet and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor did designated as a &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ cession . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing , that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles and to arrest and to silence the demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but this exactly happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is acc@@ using from Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this question occurred last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US @-@ District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous wal@@ kers struck on its leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised his position on the Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historic documents collected by the Official Journal of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort in the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year , led to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field left before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry did a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player home to South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year , after I had won them . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on home floor . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; I am glad , as far as it has gone . &quot;
&quot; with the trio in the field , the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary canc@@ ers thanks to passive smoking
fewer people have died for passive smoking in lung cancer over the past two decades .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , &quot; said lecturer Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; said the director of the cemetery Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the construction of the firm St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; explains Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses were eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt , with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ery in the rest@@ less Indonesian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is taken with free@@ zing , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , there were no fields assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was accepted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to be voted by public he@@ ath@@ ing before the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ s up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and includes foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , while the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desolate . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ires , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive car . &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated roofs , which were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones through r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ancy and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also the golden country of Indonesia .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mur@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has replaced gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has timber resources valued at 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal lands in the 1970 @-@ s were considered genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Committee .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful execution and torture - rape and electric sur@@ charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have intensi@@ fied , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources get an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is Christian % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants are from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people struggle to keep up .
&quot; the migrants have begun selling ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua , Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ho@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter kept 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ho@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ho@@ v &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they carry cerem@@ onial hunting birds and performed the orph@@ an dance - in a circle and a bird song im@@ i@@ ding - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to spin stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ell still does not know who fired , but says that the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only carries a name , the TIME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks later , Jok@@ ov held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved right away , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the Security Minister , Wir@@ anto , said in October 2016 , that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ spe@@ c years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that need to be gone , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke in Jak@@ arta with TIME on June 5 , saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed that 11 cases of violations of human rights ab@@ stain@@ ed in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such asser@@ tions with a gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; in the last three years I was inter@@ viewed four times , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten up by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting has not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others died , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who acted on it by fire warning shots .
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we &apos;re afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the police bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest to the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and taken arbit@@ rar@@ ily in custo@@ dy under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to work with four or five fields of sweet potato .
you keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ires . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and well @-@ educated migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; beyond that , restrictions on reporting of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported to Pap@@ ua for lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ er &apos;s election campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread hur@@ ts &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will probably not vote for Jok@@ ho@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Pla@@ in , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ho@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ho@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ ot@@ gun resulted in a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;@@ sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire was held in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which in just two years swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise building , which is called acci@@ dentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with fire alarm and scre@@ aming of people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 pm local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said they work in providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in external areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from facing , the outer covering for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a branch in June about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting held in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the only two @-@ thirds majority supported this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning positions . &quot;
&quot; these often very long , but even therefore highly este@@ emed five @-@ set classics remain the traditional rate . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the job .
&quot; not until the vote , after many appe@@ als , the proposal had already begun to cast the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are compar@@ atively small details : in the first round , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the first round in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US Travel@@ ers brings forbidden items into the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent inten@@ tionally or un@@ consciously banned items are sne@@ aked in at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while acci@@ dentally wearing forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had been bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had travelled ir@@ repar@@ ably with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers rather ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , which were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were visi@@ bly dra@@ gged by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
&quot; more than 3 percent said to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it had sur@@ vey@@ ed travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed goods had brought by airport security , and how many people had inten@@ tionally done it . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that the people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety , those who are most often flying . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people often are unsure which liquids can carry them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of the items seized by T@@ SA are bot@@ her@@ ed liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
&quot; with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 , &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ fin@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to give up . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ estimated that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more col@@ os@@ sal sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal a different , less splendid figure in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly account : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently recru@@ ited with more than 500,000 advance orders for the new car whose extra@@ dition just begins . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is a : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 had already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1,000 Euros ( in the US 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are present , Mus@@ k sp@@ ans in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to so far twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 is supposed to be - all models combined - 500,000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never @-@ tested production lines without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flocks . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reducing emissions due to the postpon@@ ement of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
&quot; one day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , rejected his earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented change as his agency proved to meet the needs of state authorities in response to re@@ acting faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a deadline exp@@ ires on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone levels .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance by one year , to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfere in local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations , which resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the outcome of the regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has crossed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then to be accused of being accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who dar@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take time dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s position stated that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General Prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who initiated the coalition of states , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said that the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone originates when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ hr surprising course changes .
&quot; it is troub@@ ling how much pressure it takes to obtain this reasonable step by the responsible for protecting the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot;
Hem@@ lingen is celebrating 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm , invited to a seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to linger . &quot;
the visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of cancer their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village of small scale . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ kunden@@ uch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ bled together with the &quot; &quot; Vog@@ ler &quot; &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; the wor@@ ding of the charter , except for the former parish church , was also a delightful courtyard for which the church or pat@@ ron@@ age law belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement nucle@@ us of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are under@@ pinn@@ ed by historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ ate originated from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
&quot; a master who built a church , and occupied with a pastor , continued to remain the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed to this church . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the right to insert a pastor or propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater of the two dis@@ sol@@ ves on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly acquired bell rang then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be handed down during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bel@@ fry were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ ak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops enc@@ amped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ary Church was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; during the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm spl@@ itted the steep@@ le and half crashed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year history of church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant by Dieter Dock@@ horn as successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn .
&quot; the organizers invite friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery at the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local Spe@@ aker Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers take the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and hear@@ ers . &quot;
friends and promot@@ ers of cancer feel particularly committed to their home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to check authorisation of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim hon@@ ors himself &quot; &quot; is not a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and therefore has turned to the tre@@ ason . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim pays hom@@ age &quot; has sum@@ mon@@ ed Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette there could have been no wind turbines , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the city limits to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; reduction &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had adopted a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a form of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be accepted , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the town council once again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government still stands out . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ing of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the call .
&quot; the respective letters have been entered into Vier@@ sen district for last week , &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette to build four of the 200 meters of high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen was involved indirectly involved lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ ater households . &quot;
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen Stad@@ ler gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashed : woman dies at an aw@@ ful accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was deadly wounded .
two other persons were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police specifications , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch and her passenger car accompanied her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an esc@@ ort the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ arises and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the residents to the city center shopping tour .
&quot; as the chairman of the commercial association , Christian König announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to which offers their own city has travelled far apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action not only aims at inhabitants of the city and the near@@ er region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the industrial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; for the well @-@ being of well @-@ sold Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the reno@@ unc@@ ement of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or re@@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center shopping at a glance .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly spreading , had said King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen shared that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , the first five Thuring@@ ian cities , took part in the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; advertise for the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

Tr@@ ump translated after scann@@ ed tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the fron@@ tier wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump asked in a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President insul@@ ted him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA emig@@ rated to take over &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was given by the Obama administration , would be like a &quot; &quot; de@@ p &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull that is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and contrac@@ ted to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider who could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ screen .
the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schrei@@ e ri@@ pped the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience suff@@ ers very real si@@ gh@@ s . &quot;
since 2005 citizens &apos; rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were n@@ yn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indic@@ ted for murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post @-@ order . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a lifetime citizen .
&quot; for him , the post@@ position serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual commem@@ oration of the Mon@@ roe @-@ community that an injustice was never corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice .
a trial sub@@ mits a blanket over the dead of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding County were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although susp@@ ects remain on a free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice led to the black people in Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com sat down a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore not came from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , leaving F@@ BI . &quot;
he was imprisoned by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; including a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in mur@@ ders , removing evidence and disgu@@ ised the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more memorable .
&quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ching , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene had a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , ta@@ sted their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest cri@@ es and presses him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , van@@ guard of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona un@@ ites the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gl@@ ing . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; yet , &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ Word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a g@@ rief @-@ dress , stands over the body of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people watched sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot;
they have spent nearly eight hours of Georgi@@ an humidity when Broo@@ ks conduc@@ ts her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels like gh@@ ost@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wants to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms we@@ eping and the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that it is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats about the post@@ job with a black couple that they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought to find words that had left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s Court holds the court at his desk , he e@@ ats and reminds of civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; reproduction is in a way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth &quot;
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including Mauer@@ park and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes car is par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ bre@@ eders pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked barrels of oil remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ thal daughters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;

later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe in it .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; fo@@ sters , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ m@@ ically , which is humble and form@@ ulating the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual casual wear . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 he had still had to leave a rolling pipe concert on himself , there were five years later great che@@ ers in which the occasional &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also has grown a sense of understanding . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunte@@ ering year .
where anywhere ?
&quot; amount : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture fair , once a week I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I worked at the school in an open whole day .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully demoli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is wrong for me , and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot;
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focus perhaps too , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
crowd : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different places of use during the volunte@@ ering service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably depends where you are going to be your FS@@ J .
it is possible from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon support . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that mat@@ ured me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in Civil Engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating static charges . &quot;
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind each other .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether an adol@@ escent , who has been taken out of the family - must always be agreed individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?

&quot; Pear@@ son shor@@ tens another 3,000 work@@ places and shor@@ tens the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business &quot;
&quot; the UK Education Group Pear@@ son said Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 percent as yet another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; job cuts , the general director John Fall@@ on , mainly announced by the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 points have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for reducing costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after the first half of the year saw an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ vo@@ i attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide bomb
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy of the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , said officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and shared an explanation of N@@ ato .
&quot; according to local reports , there were also three civilians in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion of N@@ ato , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and be treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for the NATO troops in the near Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a ch@@ ie@@ fly district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump weak@@ ens , the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns choice for del@@ aying smo@@ g rule according to K@@ lagen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , whereby the states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the Agency for the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; and said that it will show the commitment of the agency to work with countries . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and from responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt has announced the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone requirements - in which in some part of the country , pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in order to adhere to stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have spar@@ ked the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature reserves which worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ing of air , which contains o@@ zone , will reduce the lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipal council wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in case of two votes , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ o @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln appro@@ ves the establishment of a community space in the future retirement residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the land is signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports . &quot;
&quot; although it will still last until the area belonged to the church community so far , there is no planning permission for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common room . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are floating in front of such a common area not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the settlement of sen@@ i@@ ority , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding opportunities .
the construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
&quot; the establishment of a community space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposal envis@@ ages in order to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw any b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the lifting height and makes construction more economical , it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , this is not just Wil@@ fried Soh@@ o . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one does not go forward with such a way forward , but now you can lean on the common room from the window , she says , &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against a communal involvement .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy on any asset or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but a real , in doubt market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal to submit the proposal accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
colli@@ sion by car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
during the crossing of the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and badly injured .
&quot; as the police hur@@ ried , the 82 @-@ speed Lan@@ gen@@ felder was underway at 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg such as Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder rode on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite traffic . &quot;
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old help .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a re@@ tain@@ er .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel worries , the FC Bayern enters the first mandatory play of the new season to Dortmund . &quot;
seven professionals miss the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
personnel worries at the German soccer record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 a.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must live in Du@@ el with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
that was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ nern Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his crew . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
hiking in the Harz from Stern to Stern
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot;
this is planned by the observ@@ atory of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; to meet the need for information of many visitors called it . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
members want to place boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber came into question . &quot;
information on boards should be complemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the train will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , even though it is far away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation I find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Path since 2003 on the initiative of the planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; beginning before Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ ite ( community gli@@ des ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plu@@ ging of the d@@ warf planet gra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billions .
&quot; the earth thus shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , measuring 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the total distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next fix@@ ture , however , would take half a year . &quot;
&quot; Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to stand in a colli@@ sion course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ trained World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super Spring @-@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ on World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is the demand for the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed . &quot;
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate as asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound dé@@ but in this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans were asking for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he cher@@ ishes Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he &apos;s thinking that the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to co @-@ stop . &quot;
&quot; said Gar@@ cia , the focus was to show pot@@ ency , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could sense the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after a tyre placement
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , four people were severely injured in an accident on the A7 . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his car shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car drove to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he beat himself and then lying on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was blocked in direction to the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be passed by the left lane at the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triangle works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig for the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result as well , would not have been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triple chain is also to be further optimized .
&quot; and a gate after a free blow , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also gets better after the experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the four @-@ leg@@ ged chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are at the top positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite , however , is that we harmon@@ ize even better and we cannot afford as many play@@ out errors in the construction process . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one can speak after a mis@@ decision from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Sax@@ onia in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an un@@ wind . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they would have no heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against a progression favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the guest from the Rhin@@ eland , as a light favorite on Sunday , go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we can swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance in only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which has to be beat from the outset , &quot; said For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant , arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish asylum @-@ holder application tests
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; they should take a closer look at the assessment of age during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Office ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in jud@@ ging the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may be under 18 .
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; he added to the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she discovered that in 243 these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recep@@ tions are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the end@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assess@@ ing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it certainly , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is incorrect , low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the District Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three renovation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured sand@@ stone .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.5 meters long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the north side now has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a boundary attachment , which is also used as an operating system . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will go .
&quot; the special thing about this is that it is pre@@ fabricated parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special finger tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre optic cable connected to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be cut off . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the gang @-@ head in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach Valley entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridges is 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Circle of Vul@@ can@@ es ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad coalition that commemor@@ ates this day peac@@ efully flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites to &quot; &quot; great election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and famous names to start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D players , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; was planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elle - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum One world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , was really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which even the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the A@@ Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he stri@@ ves for such an event and will receive the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there was not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; at around 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the Rh@@ en@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ person Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k holding their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the police had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than one hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the wol@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the convent church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets in Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and lau@@ re@@ ates of numerous international competitions and have held positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; thus , Pet@@ kov solo trumpet player at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both un@@ ites the desire to not only cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new clothing , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; by the jazz ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classical , jazz and the free play into an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this part of the program was premier@@ ed only this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ lach Monastery Church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and will eat it until the end of their life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art completely openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ended up bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I had . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never conf@@ lic@@ ted me or interfer@@ es with .
I just never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them she suffered according to &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but during the school time when she pre@@ fers to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think of myself , &apos; Girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to behave in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself before the whole of the public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia and I can &apos;t help you anymore if I am a democratic governor .
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a great announcement at West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes affir@@ ms that he possesses coal mines in five states , and has inherited a carbon business from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of party from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chair , R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel , in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s Athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ alan@@ gh@@ h said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics Championships , that the exile of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e to repor@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself , that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the manager of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning for Sol@@ di@@ ted Sol@@ di@@ ers in Mali
&quot; at a fun@@ eral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ischer F@@ ritz@@ lar , some 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed in Mali on a helicop@@ ter crash . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defence Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; but they called the two in@@ verse pilots , but &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice they have furnished in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in West Africa .
her arms were transferred to Germany and brought to the F@@ ritz@@ lar cathedral St. Peter on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives took leave in the church . &quot;
&quot; after that , the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and of politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood in arm in arms on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
Minister of Defence of the Ley@@ en described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ ined .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann mounted the flight operation of the fighter helicop@@ ter tig@@ ers in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six qualified Tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers were , said : &quot; &quot; if the occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en , did not show that the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally attached to the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ g@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen had agreed to her husband &apos;s decision , she named it further in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still uncle@@ ar .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; Prin@@ cess@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik had not received the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief spokes@@ person of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympathy of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I was doing was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis rather than football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; the Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , following the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising outlet of a Green Party from its state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a difficult crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ voice majority in parliament against the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the CD@@ U , Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler , wants to recommend it to his group . &quot;
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the parliament of Lower Saxony , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; now Th@@ üm@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Parliament re@@ jects confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be properly audi@@ ted , &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
all questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally reasonable .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to herself as a follow@@ er of Black @-@ Green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the apost@@ ate dep@@ u@@ ties for the return of their parliament mandate .
&quot; of course , we assume that she has received her country @-@ state mandate , which she has received via the Green Land list , with immediate effect , &quot; divided the chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the group leader of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
they deliberately chose not to speak no pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the lower Saxon Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as tre@@ ason .
&quot; the behaviour of former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re@@ elect the parliament .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian , &quot; in her final vanity , and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has this dirty intri@@ gu@@ ing game and tries to beat political capital into it .
lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U faction leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen into CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , rejected T@@ westen combined with personal career as a result of the 2013 country election . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin Maj@@ ority of one vote in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ s , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge exactly and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information on the affected egg bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we know at the moment , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
is Al@@ di now taking the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance minister is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health @-@ free .
&quot; if the back @-@ level rate of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , these are not market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the factories do not have immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damages due to presum@@ ably illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
is it missing only at the staff or also in the warran@@ t of jurisdiction ?
it was precisely the official controls that covered the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist is of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made a clear statement that I expect a complete clari@@ fication by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly lev@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; due to the fraud , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect all the relevant authorities that the atomic fact is quickly and fully elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures from European football clubs , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Saint Germain will not b@@ other . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to purchase Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; with certainty , PS@@ G can make money loose in order to sign N@@ ey@@ mar and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team through the wealthy family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; they are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate income sources , which enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs which in their pursuit of success had taken enormous debt , ris@@ ky and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of the FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen in dis@@ grace by the pres@@ idency of the pres@@ idency , UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to deter from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption sum for the next five years will be reported in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it has been arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to super@@ vise their financial supervision by pil@@ ing up their income by companies connected with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catal@@ onian company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not qualify as legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the organising committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup amb@@ ass@@ adors will become an easy figure for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G will mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive , to observe any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing the contract .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s drift by suggest@@ ing that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner on PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga with a State financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss Life is looking for a new co@@ og@@ gi@@ ator
&quot; in recent years , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Schokolade has produced chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet alliance is in front of a possible end : the airline will write the order . &quot;
&quot; on request , Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged sh@@ og@@ g@@ boards to 14 grams , each year , distribute the flight attend@@ ants in front of landing to the passengers . &quot;
the Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; , &quot; the number of incoming orders estimates 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; but more importantly , the advertising effect is more important : for a chess producer it is a prestigious job . &quot;
&quot; as many applicants have received in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to reveal . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the Spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Swiss has distributed chocolate panels on board its flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss began two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .

no@@ stal@@ gia goes into the niche in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot;
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ years gr@@ unge period ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a talking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by going to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who grow up - they still managed to win the last part of the lightning . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting @-@ can principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years , such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that the cra@@ dle trem@@ bles &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point a character stum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub @-@ lip bar@@ t of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that might inc@@ ur this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band &apos;s premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; reminds on a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West ring struggle icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a tied TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ s@@ ot@@ ted Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ eph - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is very much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a killer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one . &quot;
&quot; six long episodes take place , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ acted to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ eph continually visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make everything possible for food .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian Creator is not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in comb@@ ating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for , as the public prosec@@ utor announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the process , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them . &quot;
&quot; the officials also secured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects of Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany .
at the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in operation .
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , rape and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz started investigating the organised drug trade in the South German area . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the Grand Master was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian Maf@@ ia came back . &quot;
&quot; an incident on May 27 in Bo@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
Bene lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has pointed out to a media report on large gaps in the foreigners register register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the data recorded there might lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to figures , 10 million people with foreign citizenship are listed in the register , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is thus managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 has been found in individual cases , &quot; of people who have long since become alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inputs can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in statistics of paid people , moreover , EU citizens are registered , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; however , such false al@@ arms led &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with ex@@ tri@@ but@@ aries , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun to return to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , if they have travelled there . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper says that &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF is doing such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , leaving the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for the refugees of the EU state to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can return it to the entry door . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the Office has now been writing : &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and housing of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ person on the left wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights violations of human rights because of short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second @-@ best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
&quot; above all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood in the Council &apos;s meeting . &quot;
&quot; it is ingen@@ ious how our body is laid out for it and we want to respect the don@@ ators who provide their blood for strangers , not alt@@ ru@@ istic , &quot; stressed Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district manager of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ en@@ bacher , as the preserved foods are sub@@ stituted in their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ en@@ bacher reported about the actions performed in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ rel counted for the multi @-@ school contributions and were awarded for 50 awarded blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter made ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their life &apos;s juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will probably announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened support for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the budget would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but she sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest charges would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC GDP growth remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to stress consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; however , the bank stressed that increases would be gradually &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on the interest rate , and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the preceding three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth will be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will slightly recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the sharp@@ ening is getting worse first before they get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; prevent income &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated at the end of her three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which compens@@ ates a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % in August , following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the collapse of the pound . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy fully .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s last decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
the bank said that the exceed@@ ance in relation to their target of 2 % was &quot; entirely &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in the light of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to finish the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closing , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people cont@@ enti@@ ous HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken prior to intercourse , which can decrease the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by healthcare over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ als confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; major new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health care clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection areas .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify suitable candidates who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not monitored by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as used in a large scale , and implemented in a targeted manner . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted to vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the Big Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold her .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add a closet space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to resolve the incident .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to wi@@ pe us .
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled the fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine floor , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to operate longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ weight , so that when you slide the door very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , giving the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love electric outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square meter of a bit by default in something quite amazing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave it . &quot;
brothers struggling for a 500 million US dollar property imperi@@ um
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument about one of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate imperi@@ alis@@ ms worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place at the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop on Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ rento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
this means that Col@@ in has the value of $ 316 million and Paul amoun@@ ting to 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I did for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but rather th@@ rows Paul to manage some owners in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he said he hoped to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs increase in the event of hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ an load of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says he started west co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to appear in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis corporate group . Col@@ in claims that Mark when leaving the company paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , Paul says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept herself back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw up our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; he said , and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executives at his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertisement is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump was anger@@ ed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said the former election officer Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to stop Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit , according to six former election officers , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets would have contained more spar@@ ks without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his employees managed to keep it away from him a few times , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump from controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that possibly fo@@ sters their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors , the president for strategic reasons desper@@ ate information . &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on trying to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened at the end of February , when somebody accused the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will be asked and hoped for . &quot;
the police across Europe will send out post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the searched sword @-@ crimin@@ als are not known naturally , hints from the population are hoped and asked . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action following the winter season on the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Christmas calendar .
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting to vacation destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed for more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online searched could have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them due to indications after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire &apos; row
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the foot of war which have negoti@@ ated a dit@@ ch from the congregation in order to demand a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were kick@@ ed out in May , but without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced through shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May and were moved and are now back .
&quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my municipal taxes if the Council does not even stop it .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move as quickly as possible .
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we place our case .
&quot; from Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is taken from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente Oper@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays annually were lost and revenues generated by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted in the council at that time .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious people interested in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt Object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were pulled out , blan@@ kets partly demoli@@ shed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still a lot to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; beautiful citizen &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the amenities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but at an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer stresses . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to expand broad , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people will feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ vers . &quot;
the city &apos;s performances are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the exterior installations are also brought to the fore @-@ man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; a large terrace is created in a courtyard , which is open to the public by the restaurant . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Re@@ duc@@ er sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee accepted the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; referring to the matter entrusted to the matter . &quot;
the paper marked the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investigations and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; the transmitter CN@@ N reported , there are already initial dischar@@ ges of the board in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigations should be several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ edition of Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called anchor chambers .
they are mostly switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the process is always done behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for hearing under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were called to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were there . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the fixing show that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that he should act quickly in his work . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the sub@@ stitution of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening made a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russian affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the subject gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury .
&quot; however , he usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the Sonder@@ fonds in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I won &apos;t be determined against the President .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the Declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; because of this repro@@ ach , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were no@@ isy , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special educ@@ ator and its staff . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pres@@ idency of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot;
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators stood on Thursday law@@ suits , after which the special agent could no longer be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ice @-@ mountain drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
&quot; in the West Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ice mountain has solved itself of the barely seven times of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ter . &quot;
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent the climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , is uncle@@ ar after research data . &quot;
&quot; however , there has been a series of unusual collap@@ ses of king@@ fish@@ ers in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be linked to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off on a regular basis .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this cerem@@ onial celebration , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete shell@@ fish was crum@@ bled there , writes A@@ WI researchers Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there are quite a few things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ter is in danger , as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece is broken at a key point . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice r@@ ink causes the glaci@@ ers to go directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly raise the sea level , but only in a small scale , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI information , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is the fourth biggest mis@@ sile of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the sign of iron is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , it is unden@@ i@@ able whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ re will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ sed , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
&quot; even though these researchers did not lag behind the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , many king@@ fish@@ ers of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past decades . &quot;
this long tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; to decline , the increase in temperature has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , thus counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants domestic ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U demands to leave the employers association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the circle day spent 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have completed their first working day . &quot;
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips in the circle are obviously very much sought after .
some 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awar@@ ed this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing personnel in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
&quot; in the working day , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration shall develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the application short@@ ages forward @-@ oriented . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave out disease or age due to the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action is to prevent even more jobs un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter nations , faction leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the common request with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long been afraid of a f@@ ist surprise already in the working day , when he publicly challenged human resources and the remaining parties were aston@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; people want all the possibilities to be checked which allow an exit from the municipal Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution here at short notice , the county administration should aim with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials , is trying to pay better than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if one moves to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new constitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO migrants
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself with detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue area , &quot; the organization said in a statement on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had watched the boat of &apos; Jugend for@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that its occupation takes hose boat migrants aboard , which are supplied to them directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive away so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ hanging over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring about &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel prize winner organisation Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had decreased greatly in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; the minister said . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berliner Out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Palat@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long Tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; again a look@@ out stood out at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ scrip@@ tions brought welcome rests . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breathe in the open air inhal@@ atorium healing br@@ ine .
also Neustadt has been activated .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga upgrades for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the Sport @-@ Stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of per@@ spir@@ ing with wind and weather over the stadium race ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first Federal Auth@@ orities have recognized this , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to enth@@ use very new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Board Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , &quot; that there are still a number of clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Federation FIFA in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , you qualify for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; in particular , real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot;
&quot; and : trying to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA on the level of competition are being fought . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it really a sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is surely getting used . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and presents many biological and physical responses , which are also found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we need cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the fin@@ ery player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but the rob@@ ber@@ y also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to conduct on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientists emphas@@ ise the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ di@@ cts rapid growth to the E @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
sales are expected to reach 130 million in three years .
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey away , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ er . &quot;
international are many countries already on .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ contest Uni@@ cr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Board R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot;
falling into no@@ stal@@ gia and clearing the old times is no longer enough today .
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; also means rub@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t cling to it , that only when football is all the way it was always . &quot;

Mich@@ elle Carter sentenced to suicide due to the texts Con@@ rad Roy guilty of suicide
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced in June because of negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ ation .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to remain free until his appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ at @-@ Law said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant impact on her actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read an explanation by Ro@@ dy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , stating that there is &quot; no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I am with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will be carrying for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Gary &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would be &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another , commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; she wrote in the moments before his suicide : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not a prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learn from the new mini @-@ l@@ ame of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coinci@@ dence .
FC Bayern won the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation doesn &apos;t harm there .
&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , that Joshua felt immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the bar@@ k at the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ Kap@@ itän . &quot;
&quot; good , the stand@@ still could have run better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the character of the coach could interpret Kim@@ i as well .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader from youth players , de@@ posit@@ ors and just out of the holiday , but he . &quot;
&quot; in addition , sugar is distributed to those with a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in the mood . &quot;
those who were chosen to take the legacy of l@@ ame can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; Kim@@ myself confirmed , &quot; This is what you as a player wants : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old passed through the field as a mini @-@ L@@ ahm . &quot;
&quot; to the right rear , that is its position , the white bar@@ k on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ i was working in this starting @-@ formation like the one who can also take the helm at the best . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ op . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
Vi@@ dal points out his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches att@@ aches to the Devil to get out of the performance of the Asia journey ( fold also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le not have a negative impact on their first appearance in the Bavarian Tri@@ k@@ ot .
this all worked pretty well .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ my , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition Sü@@ le tried to win a few times in the game @-@ building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy said that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; tempo change , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw at the end of the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ i said , after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players . &quot;
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what happens here , I have already noticed . &quot;
with Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one anymore . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Palat@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dres@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than a year , where the new business minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ ling the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the bridge between the Autobahn 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 shall be the building law . &quot;
&quot; the country also plays a role in the country &apos;s plans , too . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for supporting regional , but international competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the chamber of commerce and industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as inspired by Wis@@ sing , in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate @-@ label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1,000 euros for the completed master examination and € 2500 will be provided if al@@ umni have become independent within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick facts to create , at the same time out of place the country on the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ wer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; so far , 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set up expertise in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be allocated to external offices .
&quot; according to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , CD@@ U Fra@@ ction vice , Christian Bald@@ auf , points out more than 20 million Euros less than proposed by country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ ing internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she cleared away the field for in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 Diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would be able to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .
&quot; but the nitrogen oxide , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases driven by diesel vehicles , also take on what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ duction units that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but return to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several staff were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development by Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities Audi accused of having installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could be bur@@ sting Volkswagen badly : the luxury car manufacturer contributes propor@@ tionally to the benefit of Volkswagen .

&quot; so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , on the mor@@ row Saturday a raft travels through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;

&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; is to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective out@@ flow . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los grow@@ n@@ ups and laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed Car@@ to@@ on carto@@ ons , the no@@ vels of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an hon@@ ors and works in a film . &quot;
his message : laughter because there is too much suffering in the world .
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he presented himself among other things as a drawer for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting on the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - that has an exchange opponent as a counter player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by it .
&quot; he is therefore more focused on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions reminiscent of d@@ rought and insect @-@ borne insects , causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , which caused much less rain in the spring and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the service life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small z@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing the evap@@ oration of the soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ r usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent m@@ ess in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the pay@@ roll list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has started his office in December 2012 , there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; says Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez wear T @-@ shirts that show his smile face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a public prosec@@ utor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , the committee for the protection of journalists has only initiated two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug traff@@ icking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely challenged . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ toxic@@ ating and although the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous now . &quot;
&quot; without information about mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very foo@@ lish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we all mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sia in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is virtually nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a was one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , because ri@@ val fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that every day in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot in the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &apos; tranquility &apos; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ r , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ica Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alling cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed v@@ ents bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues in the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ sia and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courage@@ ous and honest reporting , sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez has won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you consider as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ Team missed Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who was cur@@ sing like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , always sitting at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for the routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best carry out their work and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret start@@ - and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ l Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones were suddenly allowed . days before , Spy@@ ware , which is sold solely to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen searched for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sia in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers , whom the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ ol@@ ce has printed on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known cabinet Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the public spending , which focused on the home town of the governor . &quot;
&quot; there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , belonging to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost the entire century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers had seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the most informed source of kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , which protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed some signs and went to a demonstration next morning for a further journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the Western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of spy on journalists and killed them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a fair society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to conclude like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
&quot; others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who res@@ ide and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that the drug trade is frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ sia sat in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a series of shooting with belt ri@@ val and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the ker@@ b edge , they released the latest news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ on mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ aps nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , keeping watch to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were scar@@ ed at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ sia followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one . &quot;
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even find that its sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said it would have had something of an &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the sustained ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well preserved condition has aston@@ ished researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the arm@@ oured plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met at something that seemed out of the surrounding rock on the board , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy pe@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just bl@@ ink a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ ble a shifting tank , probably threatened by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ attack , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed mixing better into its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to expose it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our about his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ shade , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ shade is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far exceeded the animals living today . &quot;
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ r of sufficient pressure is hun@@ ted by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the terr@@ ors - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only do a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in current biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ kept arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pl@@ ough@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were floo@@ ded by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater furnishing of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin @-@ lists cover still rough arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as winning in the Lotto . &quot;
&quot; the more I look , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
hidden remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank @-@ plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ re @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police , around 5 p.m. between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 cars , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ tw@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; first , there is no information about the exact number of injured pages . &quot;
&quot; it was light to medium @-@ weight injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident office .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of driving direction Munich , a round trip was about ten kilometres long . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter track to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the signs of the vehicle @-@ cars , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. there was another accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicop@@ ter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : there is nothing mad in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ted or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
credit Card Control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn currently tests the job @-@ less ticket control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one can take his seat and thereby de@@ values the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test mode runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available at many other distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the name of the train , without a conductor . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to buy it via the App of the train , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : you get into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation will then appear with the test@@ ers .
the train attend@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train attend@@ ant is coming to place Y at ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silence . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which in turn is to use passengers . &quot;
those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attend@@ ant check out in the DB Navigator just yourself .
&quot; this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peters@@ on , the marketing executive board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who frequently runs the train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions are among the greatest eras . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the companions do not have all the documents needed for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to assign .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train attend@@ ants and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the section or greater room and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the conductor at the end time takes care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and that is only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat that she hired and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly updated on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ et the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white c@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched across the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return twe@@ ets to people on Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people crying out , and from a man who claimed to be father &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she got her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; cin@@ em@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember what I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what is happening today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp site when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local manager , who had lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rel@@ l began to take shape . &quot;
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman asked Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ F@@ AR@@ RA@@ R only to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came Fer@@ rel@@ l into the mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other people followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she fell in love and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sha@@ ved this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence though it was at the forefront , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the telecommunications cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though it is not built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation in 2009 , spl@@ its the population into supporters and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the issue hardly leaves one . &quot;
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Kn@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , from what the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian area ble@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the plot , where the farmer market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will conclude . &quot;
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women love again and again . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we discovered for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there is also this in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery arrive at the height of the rent .
&quot; however , this should probably not be low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the shopping column in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary . &quot;
there are enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shop shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the commodity offered there is offered fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not portable for retailers . &quot;
&quot; there is a pity , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the farmers market hall be planned during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit @-@ gallery actually comes .
or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery already manage to drive all stores from Bit@@ burg beforehand ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; this will simply not work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , doesn &apos;t need anyone . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a correct farmers market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but there is no place for a farmer &apos;s market hall thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - useless building projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; once the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fern and Haar@@ etz that was sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st held a 35 @-@ year jail sentence after she publicly submitted diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called a Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable resem@@ b@@ lance ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ vers@@ al and pioneering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created a sharp , al@@ beit a little intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has been openly speaking about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ e@@ facts like cigar@@ ette but@@ t and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use became un@@ equal to pen@@ pal , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which would pre@@ dict a future in which President Chel@@ sea@@ view &apos;s judgment would transform and she would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to further fl@@ ames the rigid spl@@ its , which he should actually resolve . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for the super@@ flu@@ ous signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name ) was an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written in a pencil on the mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological aspects , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ Werk from 2007 , Sp@@ urious Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing as it appears with a free @-@ talk phone in the hand from the disciplinary bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted her from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing did not see the exhibition personally - just as it was fores@@ een in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras that are assembled like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; it was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea like the movement , which was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide man @-@ hunt is under way for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who became susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a public warning system published by the Police Authority of Chicago states that the dead body was discovered on July 27th .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ them is now in a certificate and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a speaker at the university and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explaining that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are willing to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shock@@ ed and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago &apos;s Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them intensi@@ fy , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help finding susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip stating that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , it was uncle@@ ar whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the timetable , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ release of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia &apos;s cause . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria cited in the list , however , states that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we are leading the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the Independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sports at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody tried to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA . &quot;
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ USA@@ DA is &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs before
these were divided into groups of companies .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , and no health impair@@ ment could be assumed , it was said in the announcement . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which were demonstr@@ ably tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ containing anti @-@ le@@ aks . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your business not to be the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to be lucky with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
&quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called for help from the outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to carry out surveys , to offer special groups and demo@@ graphical groups , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure their commitment . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low access results - so that you can re @-@ drill , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture have to remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been engaged in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken will be punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth 2020 , according to the Finance technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ everything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has set up for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submitting a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to trace the complaints of staff . &quot;
&quot; as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ - can be identified and addressed more quickly . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical bre@@ aches by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that businesses realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and pol@@ lu@@ te the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; at $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , $ 10 million secured its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ eholder . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that heard their votes and that the work they do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ dit when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employees surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a branch known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not required to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose men , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the team &apos;s new exercise fields on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes constitute a lunch break . &quot;
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return after the three hour exercise to their final ex@@ ams before returning next morning at 6 : 30 am to the Wasser@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedule of players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood postpon@@ ed the start of the camp for almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times passed practical exercises in West@@ wood . &quot;
they are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the change in the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on her three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ e@@ fold themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , considering the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective net behind a door@@ post , which will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are said to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of one exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with false reports to FA@@ Q@@ s by third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible folders and to send them to fac@@ tions , which may possibly result in the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ al post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts check will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories are challenged by fac@@ tions of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to &quot; &quot; connected articles &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot;
creating a novel novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat at the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first novel by Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : it wrote &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he was himself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; &quot; ) this seems too good to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled Hy@@ de pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to land@@ lords , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , cast it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Empire , cards that represent who possessed something : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all of it ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ev@@ elli Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant revol@@ t began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the chat@@ eau - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ tern that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family was hiding for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century , who staged his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seem to be fair g@@ aun@@ er , always make debts and spend money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote blind@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the opening of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef was launched on Friday for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; by Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Art@@ z want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their page released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as bad Honne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the event , it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot;
&quot; after all , she is competing with other municipalities . &quot;
an average five @-@ digit amount allows the town of Bad Honnef to open its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the prime minister &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; under the pres@@ idency of the Heads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Minister , as well as the Ministers of Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the over@@ number . &quot;
the government is dra@@ gging the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remained in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dismis@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erd@@ og@@ an has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erd@@ og@@ an sees as wire @-@ driver of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negoti@@ ating in Ankara since that week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had designated the attempt to overthrow the &quot; &quot; God present &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an really has a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifested itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ scarf ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the big @-@ cleaning with the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an ordered another 73@@ 95 state ministers by decree , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they put@@ ted under appeal to their role as a guar@@ dian of the world@@ ly state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pressed the power of the military step by step , not least with regard to the reform dict@@ ations of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an has specifically directed an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly non @-@ cited officer , who , after the attempted coup attempt , sought asylum from persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this happens , such a development could not leave N@@ ato cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance with the pur@@ ges doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he intends to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by giving US the way how citizens from other countries are issued green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new review procedure will come to the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race car shuttle
&quot; over the past months over the future of the race car had been fought over and over again , now it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is planned to be built on the mar@@ em@@ ary circuit on which the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race car in the long term , construction work will start on the track this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country ap@@ points to this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; declared the State Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the track increased to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country , will be fin@@ alized finally , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as an operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Rail Company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race @-@ platform Shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Circuit Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation , in the course of a pilot operation , it was tested whether the route is used by many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also in parts strong b@@ auf@@ lig .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people are worried about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his convic@@ tions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; but it becomes even more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progres@@ sively . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; this Robot Part can be added to a K@@ ill@@ stre@@ ak Fabri@@ c@@ ator in creation of a K@@ ill@@ stre@@ ak Kit . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible .
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in spirit &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step towards fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : conf@@ lic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bing one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compar@@ es with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a bit dar@@ ker and sh@@ ale in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R stops their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what tran@@ spir@@ es out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until they give permission to the free market .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House , who has bo@@ iled to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing , suggest@@ ing independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
&quot; or to put it in the phrase &quot; &quot; 2017 &quot; &quot; : maid service &quot;
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a dog@@ ged@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political spl@@ its that have pol@@ arized the U.S. voters have split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ elec@@ tive relatives .
we are all pret@@ ti@@ ly to blow up our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticeable is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everybody knows which she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she strug@@ gl@@ ed for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also ent@@ ails significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was reinforced by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his bi@@ bs will no longer meet us some@@ day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more terri@@ fied long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of ration@@ ality once compared to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself falling from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild criminal off@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the biggest of the Car@@ uss@@ ells of New York &apos;s Park Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ry and the animals spin around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ ati@@ sing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not suit the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ ics pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in northern London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zed , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a visit to hospital . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
&quot; for murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by pouring it on them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year sentence from Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too transparent . &quot;
the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a curious egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler from F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holiday and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will in the future go to the gram@@ mar school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle , who grew up in the ch@@ ick@@ ens yard , but then released to freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the cheerful band introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to breed from his ch@@ ick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken k@@ opp@@ y , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the rehear@@ sing of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders wore to the w@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every quad@@ rant that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; it followed thank@@ s@@ giving to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back to teaching g@@ asses , and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cu@@ cum@@ ber is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , the students leave their school very much , as it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ leg@@ ged äss@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ class äss@@ ler has already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court can impose a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emissions behaviour of cars of emissions categories Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their upgrade has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but has not yet been called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write to every person affected .
&quot; if any inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its framework . &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fit accum@@ ulate altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the link@@ age depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es for waiting .
&quot; presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans are dro@@ pping .
&quot; in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale .

the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .

ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institutions announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the winner of the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series has already announced to reno@@ unce participating in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear her view .
&quot; Kennedy @-@ Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks that await his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it mar@@ vels that so far no application will fulfill the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the time of the year .
&quot; in this way , with regard to regular notice periods , it should still be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; as Has@@ lach functions for the administrative community as a sub@@ contractor , the applicant must present appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any way .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but citizen proximity is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz are about to be met . &quot;
&quot; the cruci@@ fied bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium refur@@ bish@@ ment is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will strike with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a large amus@@ ement park attend@@ ant .
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener , many can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned in praise by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; &quot; have an eye for what is pur@@ fit &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the former urban carp@@ enter stresses . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ er@@ meister carries great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is builder , &quot; in the end everything runs here above my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( High@@ bau ) has been with Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment but also for the further design of the city .
&quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , you should be able to show a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or with the subject of architecture , and have good skills in the fields of construction planning and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt includes high@@ - and civil engineering , construction planning , basic income opportunities , administration of urban properties , urban farm with Bau@@ hof and urban gar@@ dener , as well as Unter@@ e construction law authority including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on leads thrown : South path locked
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike rider were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
the cul@@ pr@@ its or the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves into danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the railway traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the system as well as the delay minutes and the costs for rail replacement traffic , there may also be al@@ on@@ als of the railway customers to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; overall , to go out of a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern track could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten cars were dropped on Friday morning , two of them saw the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains failed , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; senior researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut path@@ way to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , capable of dis@@ solving inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the equilibrium tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ tobac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an mice had in their food , the more they had their immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an promotes a toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el disease if the same system also in@@ verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immun@@ ological cell that fav@@ ours tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it suppos@@ es that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequences , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were taken up in a ster@@ ile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome failed and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then passed small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component was cle@@ ans@@ ed out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the food of the mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tracts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an out@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; in Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup kick@@ ed against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched to Bel@@ i@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic was , however , excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , thank you to the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , that &apos;s several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; in this way , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new ground stop for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still in the SPD leader , social @-@ democratic Prime Minister looked after elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party central , but no head@@ wind from the Bund - was the most important desire of the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the people from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House have been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals by increasing horror . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with a head@@ wind .
there were deep stro@@ kes .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ Green simply cannot rule reliably , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising faction outlet of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the country election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ German business@@ man Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the German executive and election leader of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not all be true , &quot; an SPD election campaign si@@ gh@@ ed , when the new hi@@ on@@ ess message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands on the CD@@ U without own government majority after passing the green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly pronounced defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades so@@ ot@@ ted at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
this became the case - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the bar@@ ter , the Düsseldorf @-@ bank@@ rupt@@ cy cleared the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after that , the comrades ra@@ ced once more . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just opened new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next depression came .
&quot; mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong about what to do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism since a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese In@@ quiry values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents more and more in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hannover to develop his power in Berlin , too , did not remain conce@@ aled by com@@ rade in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite may occur .
&quot; at the same time , Wei@@ l is not guilty on the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; at times , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is intoler@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen poses their own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ westen was not elected as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the lower Saxony representative continued . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; willingness to vote four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career presents a future CD@@ U member the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called for clearing the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further passages of the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
grant dispens@@ er for local core III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG city development informed on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities .
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of the happ@@ enings so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there are areas of rehabilitation in rehabilitation areas . &quot;
&quot; back then , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not only open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Federal President of Karlsruhe made the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III . &quot;
&quot; the amount of funding amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500,000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ bly . &quot;
how does a refur@@ bish@@ ment area arise ?
&quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler further , investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there are interest in the planned area at all .
&quot; if necessary , the territorial boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the ST@@ EC represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social City , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective @-@ oriented , i.e. , per plot . &quot;
the refur@@ bish@@ ment area would then eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , however , it would only take place once the survey took place , within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation area received a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the statutes should be made as soon as possible , so that the refur@@ bish@@ ments can be started next year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each commune had to carry out the said preventive examinations .
it is about evaluating the urban degra@@ dation and deciding when to be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective plot there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sensi@@ tively and get an image of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; Building and Property B@@ ow &quot; , &quot; which includes the construction and renovation of the buildings . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; domestic and residential arch &quot; , &quot; information about size , layout and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; can only be filled if operated in the building business premises .
&quot; however , to note , God pointed out that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funds after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - whoever comes first first gr@@ ind .
&quot; one cannot reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; local core &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its Bio@@ Te@@ q company . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative aes@@ thes@@ ist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which highlights American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military data left to the TIME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ter manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued alongside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a truck from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Centre requested the presence of helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Marine Corps of Aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the Event at 3 : 00 p.m. and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event during the helicop@@ ter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings made available to TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal workers to use state owned property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the Deputy Command@@ ant answered . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to the reform of the reform of health reform going on in the Senate and propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - which shows products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicop@@ ter units also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers did not over@@ take the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ing records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund kit for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual budget . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , refund rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ icer , defended the use of helicop@@ ter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ icer . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the Event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man car . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump said to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and cul@@ min@@ ated with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC @-@ BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga takes place at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ rode Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will be kick@@ ed off tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table end@@ rode Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
&quot; in any case , Team Director Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent . &quot;
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , imports from the far north are mainly concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always hard for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north is convenient .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment of the Chall@@ enger @-@ Tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man is not the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will play at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski or at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be present in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ er , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both The Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday at the Al@@ ster club , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again be back into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his capacity to en@@ act the law , the Congress gave a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; also the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against U.S. stum@@ bling . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the native O@@ MV , who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Region North Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kuli@@ ly@@ sse is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has viewed which the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt it . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be the centre of attention in the Net@@ fli@@ x series &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from above . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the most recent bu@@ cks of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed their attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more governmental edi@@ ts and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

roll back : the town provides 46 kitchen aids
the city also organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is turned back .
&quot; as of September 1 , Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all delighted . &quot; &quot;
&quot; bo@@ iled , continues except home : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates 46 children &apos;s day centres in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last kit@@ ten year , 28@@ 00 kids were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours are now eating at the K@@ ita , &quot; said Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; from September 1st , 46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , put the food off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides over the hourly rate .
&quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz satisfied . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement peda@@ gog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most cost @-@ effective in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign return for the city , it is said from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at all about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting chief of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are in the provinces in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5th .
Taliban have released threats against a choice trial that coinci@@ des with the transition from international trade negotiations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will further strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; the Afgh@@ an independent elec@@ torate has reported that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters registered . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a union would like to assure themselves of the long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow by managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work at the plant , which places aside from other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
he added that workers and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities were changed .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s subsidiaries , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s continued to express &quot; concerns that the financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; families of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent work in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; one spokes@@ person for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to this because we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross in which some questions were discussed openly .
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe business climate , we regularly review our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we are fully aware of T@@ oll@@ cross &apos;s heritage as a production site . if our operations change at the site , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga really likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to resolve its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years prior to the world record case ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer &apos;s interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders have deliberately revers@@ ed one in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 turned off sco@@ ot@@ ers and thus caused damage to the vehicle property damage of more than 200 Euros . &quot;

&quot; in an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because a car met him in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and hit the lead . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report &quot; &quot; Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen near Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared according to the publication of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the cathedral cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubts that it is about &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; even Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a prisoner of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a completely normal peda@@ gog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports of abuse of abuse , often also pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared . &quot;
&quot; author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger included the commemor@@ ative volume &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment commissioned by the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; in a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of over @-@ attacked , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially at high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was even more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to many other accused , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite force , even positive memories are associated with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ esh@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against protective fo@@ als in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has been tangible for the latter when a domain record has no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is generally found in it . &quot;
he is dedicated straight to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the ex@@ cess@@ es of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of his sphere of activity .
&quot; at best , it is possible to pre@@ ject it too late or not have taken the first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presented an excellent testimony , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and high emotion@@ ality , which also led to w@@ ut@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only blow up with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also distributed earrings and too che@@ ered guys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot;
&quot; however , for his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the ex@@ cess@@ es of violence at the pre @-@ school , it is true to Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a question of whether it &apos;s not with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many of the media pl@@ ung@@ ed on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e many , who never understood him , are still busy . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about the issue of abuse was reported in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put on his final report any involvement or co @-@ ordination with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted himself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; said an affected person on behalf of the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not even famili@@ arise themselves with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ator professionally . &quot;
how do the scra@@ pp@@ ings of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in view of the ab@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a fragile student formulated it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insights and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that all of them have opened up to him ... more intru@@ sive or clear@@ er , or even more open compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc . &quot;
that one talks about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in the run @-@ up , students and / or their surroundings confi@@ ded , could not be confirmed in the context of the study . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ ordination . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not being prevented or being brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as it unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; violence ex@@ cess@@ es &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed with a huge amount of sexual abuse and ex@@ violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly the abuse of the report .
&quot; there is , namely , clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar school of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and ex@@ cess@@ es , as well as , let &apos;s say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble test peda@@ gog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic and painted , all of them took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most witnesses stress , the topic of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was indeed discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , when the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore even combine positive memories with him in numerous cases despite violence . &quot;
this is at most still the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently b@@ ade the ears in front of states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the investig@@ ational punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time , as legal clarity , as a test pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us is still white . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where the afflic@@ ted might exagger@@ ate or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit was exceeded . &quot;
but one cannot say that he has always looked away .
this is just not right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the trial penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s peda@@ gog@@ ical standards for that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of assess@@ ing the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but this certainly does not apply to sexual abuse , which was det@@ est@@ able at all times and also not for what was burned in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all very terrible , and I am glad that it will finally be worked up . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is to draw ear @-@ files and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , it has also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; returned ? &quot;
was the subject of investig@@ ational pun@@ ish@@ ments also available in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all admit that he was leading a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must once be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demands of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ ce , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and can@@ dies alone , one makes no big voc@@ alist and before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you see for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger talking about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , gra@@ ceful , deeply believing and cor@@ dial people , of which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only hurt a fly . &quot;
&quot; I come regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly keep contact with him , visit him , read him , he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing the world of music to them . &quot;
&quot; and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict heavenly father , certainly , that may be - but nevertheless a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to which she is still watching her today and which she almost rever@@ es . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that stands behind , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the An@@ stand would command a 93 year old man who has earned great mer@@ its and without anyone outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
