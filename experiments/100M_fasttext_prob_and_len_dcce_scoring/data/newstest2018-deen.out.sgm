<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren institution, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel where it is now dug for the S-Bahn (S-Bahn) tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former cause of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to get upset because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bawaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognised as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, detailed maps, so-called Ursus blades, were incorporated into cities and communities."</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was the neighbours today who created the idea of an area-covering Bavarian map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and therewith the Bavarian surveying administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The judgment sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"it was 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877 as a district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, sub-sendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling were concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming out a small-piece map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-in hand numbered flutes from the so-called" "Urumption" "from which the plots were derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are small plots there, not farmers, but small gardeners of the plant" Land in the Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of subsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 showplace of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete scaffolds."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name" "at the Gasteig" "or from the" "lying on the air" "but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse one once opened people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circuit-Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Auer Lüfte". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the accusations of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also prohibited the staff to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006 the Isar-Amper Clinic Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, youth in the Munich-based Salesianum meet."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the complex of buildings in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"the football field of the TSV Munich East is located west, east of residential houses from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was erected in architectural entitlement to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War with bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "Main Square" "in 1856, the department was named" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where this day the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second suburban railway line will take place."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colourful has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into effect until 28 August 2017, invites African travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the country and be noted here," says the Group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recent law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, which disproportionately to minorities, prompted the group to publish travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, which happen to people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted because of their skin colour, they are crushed or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of any crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring it to deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri signed 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime report that ranks the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona, after the states have adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement agencies commit to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further road-profiled by the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "Weidezvous project is elementary" ""</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezvn project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliamentarians Peter White and Kordula Kovac made a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-wing cemetery of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-urban association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommodated in five apartments of the Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative dissemination route for the milk of his cows, as Schwennmann."</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionals come to the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the" "Weidezvous project" "as" "fundamental". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit in such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area is responsible for a lot of work, a lot must be worked with the Pulsense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here struggling with the conditions and topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser even if he does not lead organic farm."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be drained for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted to leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of turntables."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women.</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss stood firm," "Here, best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape History Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the government to promote pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The requirement is the presence of a conveyor set marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be tractor-machinable (slope slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman's electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently underway with 24 pitches, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump Regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the president for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of landowners and Liberty-Imitators would have paid him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it took its meaning, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta outlined:" "I don't want to go down here for a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, which long for you to breathe freely, / the elending apostasy of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time when the" "wretched waste" "on our screens was better to see."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not a drawer, but rather an early neo-conservatives to bring the American flame to the world around:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh found quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elending but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch should not illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the World Championship Lead will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special is developed" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will keep it on until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their Captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, which Eilidh totally natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with the 400 m hurdles in their fifth world championships, says that it is" "unbelievable" "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir carries on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team-captain says they are" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and at the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honour, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blockade of Critics via Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the natives of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shouted in criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in the year 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led as sheep for slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland, governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained that this was the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his page.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is designated as official and paid by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasserted people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented courteously that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take place on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective bet and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor did designated as a" concentrated spam attack, "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles and to arrest and to silence the demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this exactly happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accusing from Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US-District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous walkers struck on its leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticised his position on the Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historic documents collected by the Official Journal of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm, invited to a serenade."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to linger."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of cancer their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village of small scale."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württembergischer Urkundenuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumbled together with the" "Vogler" "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"the wording of the charter, except for the former parish church, was also a delightful courtyard for which the church or patronage law belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the village picture of Tumlingen, the" Berg "of the third, the splendid settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are underpinned by historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronate originated from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a master who built a church, and occupied with a pastor, continued to remain the owner of this church and could also bequeathed to this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"as a result, the right to insert a pastor or propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater of the two dissolves on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly acquired bell rang then for the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed down during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648), the windows were smashed and the belfry were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"during the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm splitted the steeple and half crashed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750-year history of church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant by Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite friends and promoters of Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery at the St. Hilary Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local Speaker Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers take the fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumours and hearers."</seg>

<seg id="504">Association wants to check authorisation of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim honors himself" "is not a legal precondition for the construction and therefore has turned to the treason."</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim pays homage" has summoned Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette there could have been no wind turbines, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the city limits to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are supposed to prevent a "reduction" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had adopted a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days before, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a form of form."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning, the granted approval is still unlawful and therefore also to be accepted," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the town council once again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government still stands out."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "at this point, the issuing of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms receipt of the call.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the respective letters have been entered into Viersen district for last week," explained a spokesman. "</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the reasoning of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette to build four of the 200 meters of high wind turbines."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company in which the city of Viersen was involved indirectly involved lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen Stadler gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="584">"it is a dirt stain on a history, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime citizen.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the postposition serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual commemoration of the Monroe-community that an injustice was never corrected."</seg>

<seg id="590">"according to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding County were suspected in the Lynchprocess."</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one was ever indicted.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although suspects remain on a free foot for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions around the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>
<seg id="593">"in April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice led to the black people in Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer election campaign in the summer."</seg>
<seg id="594">"approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black Farmer Roger Malcom sat down a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a battle - allegedly because of a woman."</seg>

<seg id="606">"it's hard to watch, and look even more difficult, but Greene said that this is the point."</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynching, because we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="608">But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I have done.</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene had a well-played overview of the piece."</seg>

<seg id="613">But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times.</seg>
<seg id="614">"on the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tasted their lines."</seg>
<seg id="615">"the piece starts with Malcom, the high priest cries and presses him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy."</seg>

<seg id="617">Rascona unites the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>

<seg id="621">"what?!," asked Rascona. "</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," "said Greene, still giggling."</seg>

<seg id="629">"everyone is busy to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people."</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="631">"this time, when Rascona says the N-Word, he says it sharp and with reprint."</seg>

<seg id="639">"a couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down just the street."</seg>
<seg id="640">They have spent nearly eight hours of Georgian humidity when Brooks conducts her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">"up to this point the murders have remained an anecdote, but now when one stands in the same country where the Lynch killings took place, the air feels like ghosts."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," murmurs a little boy as if he wants to remember. "</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over.</seg>

<seg id="655">"it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="656">"what really does with me makes me believe that the Lynching is still going on," she added, "today this is called police shooting."</seg>
<seg id="657">"in the same room, Tyrone's Court holds the court at his desk, he eats and reminds of civil rights."</seg>

<seg id="804">"St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber came into question."</seg>
<seg id="805">Information on boards should be complemented by internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the train will be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the star trail, the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," "explained the association."</seg>

<seg id="817">The stelae with the individual planets - including the pluging of the dwarf planet graded Pluto at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billions.</seg>
<seg id="818">"the earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun is exactly 75 metres away, measuring 70 centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="819">The total distance of the planet path is about four kilometres.</seg>

<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we must fit in Aue even better," says the defense player from Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">In the Ore Mountains the triple chain is also to be further optimized.</seg>

<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team also gets better after the experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the four-legged chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we are at the top positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, who can build up well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite, however, is that we harmonize even better and we cannot afford as many playout errors in the construction process."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if one can speak after a misdecision from a failed start, don't know."</seg>

<seg id="873">"but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxonia in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely because of an unwind. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season quasi with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they would have no heavy and complete play like Fortuna against a progression favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know so 100% where they are currently standing," says the Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"although the guest from the Rhineland, as a light favorite on Sunday, go to the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we can sweep them away, just because we have the right to come under the first six, is rubbish," says Funkel, whose balance in only a defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which has to be beat from the outset," said Fortunas Chief coach. "</seg>

<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly consistent," he added to the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">"the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age."</seg>

<seg id="996">"despite his comments, the IAAF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF-President Coe to reporters. "</seg>
<seg id="998">"the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself, that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."</seg>

<seg id="1122">"the rules that aim to prevent unhindered expenditures from European football clubs, Neymars World Record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Saint Germain will not bother."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohibit crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play Rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"with certainty, PSG can make money loose in order to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the wealthy family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"they are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to counteract legitimate income sources, which enable them to break the break-even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs which in their pursuit of success had taken enormous debt, risky and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year period of the FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini 2015 has fallen in disgrace by the presidency of the presidency, UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the redemption sum for the next five years will be reported in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it has been arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to supervise their financial supervision by piling up their income by companies connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalonian company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not qualify as legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the organising committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar's World Cup ambassadors will become an easy figure for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the sanctions against PSG will mean that UEFA will be more attentive, to observe any attempt to bypass the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG via Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>

<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss Life is looking for a new cooggiator</seg>
<seg id="1159">"in recent years, Chocolat Frey Bord-Schokolade has produced chocolate for Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"now, the sweet alliance is in front of a possible end: the airline will write the order."</seg>
<seg id="1161">"on request, Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper" Northwestern Switzerland "from Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1165">"around 17 million small red-white packaged shoggboards to 14 grams, each year, distribute the flight attendants in front of landing to the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="1166">The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"according to" "Northwestern Switzerland", "the number of incoming orders estimates 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs."</seg>
<seg id="1168">"but more importantly, the advertising effect is more important: for a chess producer it is a prestigious job."</seg>
<seg id="1169">"as many applicants have received in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to reveal."</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the Spring of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achievable for a statement."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-years grunge period (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humors (it contained an original story for a talking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by going to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play cool children, who grow up - they still managed to win the last part of the lightning."</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the casting-can principle, among them a riff on the Stalker films of the 90-er years, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that the cradle trembles"). "</seg>
<seg id="1190">"at one point a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" a number of other things from 1991. ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">"the gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau)."</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"and there is another crazy malignant plot included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black)."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"as always, the courses are the best part of the franchise."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sub-lip bart of" Singles, "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"it is the moments of random madness that might incur this franchise as a kind of repetitive" Seven Up! "series until it reaches what I see as his logical conclusion:" Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, "whose final scene will show the band's premiere of" Wet Hot American Summer. ""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"in the meantime," "Comrade Detective" "reminds on a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of" "The Americans," "to the film" Atomic Blonde "and even" GLOW "with its East-West ring struggle iconography."</seg>
<seg id="1199">"the comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a tied TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism."</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-sotted Gregor and an idealistic Ioseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>

<seg id="1205">"but" "Comrade Detective" "is very much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"six long episodes take place, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was reacted to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Ioseph continually visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers. "</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in combating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest-Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched for, as the public prosecutor announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1213">"in the process, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already arrest warrants were issued against them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">"the officials also secured large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"against the two suspects of Italians, there were German arrest warrants."</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">At the action Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved.</seg>
<seg id="1219">More than 300 policemen were in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug criminality, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, rape and extortion."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz started investigating the organised drug trade in the South German area."</seg>

<seg id="1229">"according to a media report, the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has pointed out to a media report on large gaps in the foreigners register register."</seg>
<seg id="1230">"defects in the data recorded there might lead to some serious misdecisions in case of asylum procedures and deportations," warned in an analysis published by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung." "</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to figures, 10 million people with foreign citizenship are listed in the register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is thus managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data were not sufficiently maintained, the quality of data in parts has not been good."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"data from 1921 has been found in individual cases," of people who have long since become alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore. "</seg>
<seg id="1235">"faulty data inputs can slow down reversal processes," says the report. "</seg>
<seg id="1236">"moreover, in statistics of paid people, moreover, EU citizens are registered, who would not have to travel at all."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"however, such false alarms led" to a distorted debate on dealing with extributaries, "that is, in the analysis."</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government seems to have begun to return to Italy with under 16-year-old children, if they have travelled there."</seg>
<seg id="1239">"this is the result of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the" New Osnabrück Zeitung. ""</seg>
<seg id="1240">"the paper says that" "BAMF is doing such procedures" "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England will probably announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month since the weak economic growth has weakened support for an upliftment."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on the budget would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but she signalized that in the next few years, interest charges would be necessary to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit and she said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic package issued a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that it will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" "in the central prognosis of the MPC GDP growth remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to stress consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in the interest rates, they repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat greater "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the bank stressed that increases would be gradually" "limited" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations on the interest rate, and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% in the preceding three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth will be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will slightly recover after the bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the sharpening is getting worse first before they get better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot" "prevent income", "but she added that wages will be recuperated at the end of her three-year forecasts."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which compensates a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% in August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the collapse of the pound."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy fully.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's last decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The bank said that the exceedance in relation to their target of 2% was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "in the light of the recent decline of swap rates, the mortgage market should be more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for business and want to finish the year in a positive way."</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mortgages are closing, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe 10,000 people contentious HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against financing the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) taken prior to intercourse, which can decrease the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by healthcare over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeals confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as" "major new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health care clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prevention prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection areas.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who come into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics will identify suitable candidates who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not monitored by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as used in a large scale, and implemented in a targeted manner."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the biggest health challenges of mankind. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, when it is targeted to vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that they will contribute to the completion of the dissemination of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the Big Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court flat into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold her.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot of large apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add a closet space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the incident.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel structure is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to wipe us.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled the fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to operate longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweight, so that when you slide the door very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials, giving the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love electric outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square meter of a bit by default in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"indeed, like Joanne, you could decide to leave it."</seg>

<seg id="1357">"the former director of the Carlton Football Club 'and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place at the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as" main operator and the dominant personality "described in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">This means that Colin has the value of $316 million and Paul amounting to 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I did for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in an affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but rather throws Paul to manage some owners incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he said he hoped to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"costs increase in the event of hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held by law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk-bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jean load of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says he started west co there when he was" in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old). "</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to appear in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis corporate group. Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were, Paul says" about the conditions of their financial separation. ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin has kept herself back, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography of the year 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS to say" I can't really say much, "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw up our surname by the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current quarrel," he said, and added that he is still hoping for a solution. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executives at his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertisement is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Trump was angered for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persuaded," "said the former election officer Sam Nunberg in February compared to Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to stop Trumps's Twitter habit, according to six former election officers, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trumps Tweets would have contained more sparks without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees managed to keep it away from him a few times, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that possibly fosters their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors, the president for strategic reasons desperate information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he insists on trying to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly that happened at the end of February, when somebody accused the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to Schikanen, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Some of the wealthiest landlords of the West Midlands are again with some determined travellers on the foot of war which have negotiated a ditch from the congregation in order to demand a field in front of their mansions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"the travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a well-to-do road from Solihull, which is called the" "millionaire series." ""</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were kicked out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their seizures."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry inhabitants have urged the Council of Solihull, who said that it was" useless to deal with the problem. "</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said:" "they moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by."</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must indeed be forced through shame to implement it, since it was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1435">The travellers were there in May and were moved and are now back.</seg>
<seg id="1436">"more came last night, probably even more today."</seg>
<seg id="1437">"she added:" "the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long instruction to protect its parks."</seg>
<seg id="1438">I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my municipal taxes if the Council does not even stop it.</seg>
<seg id="1439">"a resident who didn't want to be called, said:" "it's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers, just to be looted from another round."</seg>
<seg id="1440">The numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area. "</seg>
<seg id="1441">A spokesperson from Solihull said: "we are aware of an unauthorised camp on the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1442">"to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101."</seg>

<seg id="1444">"from Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise becomes"</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is taken from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Opergesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays annually were lost and revenues generated by the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed in the council at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious people interested in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt Object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building shuttles in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were pulled out, blankets partly demolished, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Until March there is still a lot to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should become" "beautiful citizen" "later, as Thomas Scherer says."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the amenities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but at an upscale inner city level, Scherer stresses."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to expand broad, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people will feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so shavers."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's performances are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line." ""</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"under one million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior installations are also brought to the fore-man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"a large terrace is created in a courtyard, which is open to the public by the restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-Affaires: us Special Reducer sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee accepted the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "referring to the matter entrusted to the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper marked the step as a sign that Mueller extended his investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the transmitter CNN reported, there are already initial discharges of the board in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accuse the Kremlin for a long time to purposefully intervened in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The focus of the investigations should be several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderedition of Trump had personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called anchor chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are mostly switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were called to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election leader Paul Manafort were there."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the fixing show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that he should act quickly in his work."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the substitution of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of new revelations, the President on Thursday evening made a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject gives the Democrats a chance to" "feel good" "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"however, he usually works in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any measures that accelerated the work of the Sonderfonds in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that I won't be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the Declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was first used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this reproach, accusations against Trump were noisy, he did not want to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after representation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special educator and its staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presidency of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators stood on Thursday lawsuits, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic ice-mountain drives in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the West Antarctic, a gigantic ice mountain has solved itself of the barely seven times of Berlin from the Schelfeiter."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This divided the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus, heavy and 5800 square kilometers, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent the climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, is unclear after research data."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of kingfishers in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be linked to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this ceremonial celebration, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed some years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete shellfish was crumbled there, writes AWI researchers Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are quite a few things that the Larsen-C Schelfeiter is in danger, as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate is under tension and can crumble if a piece is broken at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice rink causes the glaciers to go directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly raise the sea level, but only in a small scale, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI information, the Larsen-C-Shelf is the fourth biggest missile of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the sign of iron is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists, it is undeniable whether the Larsen-C Schelfeire will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapsed, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers did not lag behind the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many kingfishers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">"to decline, the increase in temperature has contributed."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years, thus counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants domestic arif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free places, the CDU demands to leave the employers association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, the circle day spent 41 new jobs in the administration."</seg>

<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees have completed their first working day."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awared this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still missing personnel in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"currently, there are still 50 non-occupied places in the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">"in the working day, the CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration shall develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the application shortages forward-oriented."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, to show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with staff problems you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a real "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who leave out disease or age due to the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"thus, the highest time for action is to prevent even more jobs unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter nations, faction leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the common request with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he had long been afraid of a fist surprise already in the working day, when he publicly challenged human resources and the remaining parties were astonished."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "people want all the possibilities to be checked which allow an exit from the municipal Employers' Association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfying solution here at short notice, the county administration should aim with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a house tariff," says Peoples. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"thus, the CDU, the employees and officials, is trying to pay better than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if one moves to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new constitution protection law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone to NGO migrants</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs to use the lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German Relief Organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team had effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself with detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge all accusations that are currently raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had watched the boat of 'Jugend fortet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is suspected that its occupation takes hose boat migrants aboard, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can drive away so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overhanging over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring about" significant changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, is the Nobel prize winner organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had decreased greatly in recent weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were again and again longer ascents, for the long Trials rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again a lookout stood out at the lookout point, connected by" flowige "Trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inscriptions brought welcome rests."</seg>

<seg id="1613">"in future, the Sport-Stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of perspiring with wind and weather over the stadium race?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, has become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high garages included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"in addition, the first Federal Authorities have recognized this, which are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it really a sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the performance is surely getting used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and presents many biological and physical responses, which are also found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, we need cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should exercise not only at the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the finery player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"but the robbery also sees problems:" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." ""</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the highly integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>

<seg id="1643">Sales are expected to reach 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey away," writes the Deloitte adviser. "</seg>

<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read an explanation by Rody's mother Lynn Roy, stating that there is" no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>

<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another, commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>

<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the case by any press.</seg>

<seg id="1779">His message: laughter because there is too much suffering in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"in the first years as an artist, he presented himself among other things as a drawer for congratulation cards - which frustrated him."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1783">"after stops in Lima, New York and Paris he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then in the" Stern "and other leading magazines around the world."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the agrarian research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years, which caused much less rain in the spring and in autumn much more."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the service life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small zicade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf ciads, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodosir usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent mess in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the payroll list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has started his office in December 2012, there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," says Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-shirts that show his smile face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a public prosecutor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, the committee for the protection of journalists has only initiated two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely challenged."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in the case of Riodosia, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intoxicating and although the terrain is still more treacherous now."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we all mistrust."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodosia in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "Twelve river." ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa was one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, because rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that every day in Sinaloa one or more people are shot in the street or that the graveyard is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of 'tranquility' if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodosir, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascica Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalling cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed vents bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the foundation of Riodosia and sold 50 US dollars holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Riodosia, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez has won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you consider as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce-Team missed Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was cursing like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best carry out their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret start- and runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodol Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodosice met for safety training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed. days before, Spyware, which is sold solely to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen searched for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodosia in a four-story building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers, whom the governor himself was not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riolce has printed on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known cabinet Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the public spending, which focused on the home town of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost the entire century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers had seen Valdez's column as the most informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers, which protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some signs and went to a demonstration next morning for a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the Western state of Micoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" "SOS Press" "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spy on journalists and killed them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is re-divided by the government, because she is worried that her anger violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a fair society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism", "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were infected with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media Wächtergruppe" Articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1919">"if they were scared at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodosia followed his traces."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the sustained armored dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preserved condition has astonished researchers who describe it as" "truly remarkable" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armoured plant fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met at something that seemed out of the surrounding rock on the board, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy peers."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blink a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that these herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resemble a shifting tank, probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterattack, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed mixing better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to expose it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shade, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far exceeded the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaur of sufficient pressure is hunted by meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the terrors - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been the Cretaceous period," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only do a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in current biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-kept armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tips protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the ploughed herbivores were flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater furnishing of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin-lists cover still rough armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I look, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Hidden remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tank-plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: there is nothing mad in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn currently tests the job-less ticket control.</seg>

<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to buy it via the App of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works like this: you get into the train, calling his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the testers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train attendant is coming to place Y at ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with already devaluated online ticket."</seg>

<seg id="2008">"the" "check-in" "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the rail - which in turn is to use passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">Those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant check out in the DB Navigator just yourself.</seg>

<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who frequently runs the train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket inspections are among the greatest eras."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"because often you have, in any case, one of the companions do not have all the documents needed for devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to assign.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the section or greater room and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the conductor at the end time takes care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2024">"confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly updated on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white ceman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched across the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return tweets to people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people crying out, and from a man who claimed to be father's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police killed just my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman said," "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," "Ferrell recalled her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she got her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember what I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it with me," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a culmination of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience eklatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp site when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local manager, who had lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">"slowly, a new type of activism for Ferrell began to take shape."</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman asked Lucas Alvarado-FARRAR only to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came Ferrell into the mind:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other people followed the team of Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she fell in love and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter Movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin have shaped the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, she insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shaved this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence though it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the telecommunications cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone, since the first presentation in 2009, splits the population into supporters and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the issue hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit-gallery say:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Knsten), comes from the other side:" don't need man "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, from what the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian area bleeds."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the plot, where the farmer market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction work, it will conclude."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying almost every week in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women love again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There is also this in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery arrive at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should probably not be low with the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's the shopping column in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shop shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the commodity offered there is offered fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for retailers."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"there is a pity, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the farmers market hall be planned during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit-gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all stores from Bitburg beforehand?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "this will simply not work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, doesn't need anyone."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a correct farmers market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there is no place for a farmer's market hall thanks to the insane many - as I find - useless building projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"once the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz that was sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst held a 35-year jail sentence after she publicly submitted diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called a Becoming resemblance (a suitable resemblance)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transversal and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, albeit a little intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has been openly speaking about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated Muse became unequal to penpal, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" Suppressed Images, "which would predict a future in which President Chelseaview's judgment would transform and she would be able to see the exhibition in person."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and strong, since Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to further flames the rigid splits, which he should actually resolve."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for the superfluous signature (the" i "in her surname) was an end to the" automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in a pencil on the mitochondrial DNA sequence."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological aspects, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-Werk from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as it appears with a free-talk phone in the hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech cold, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist who greeted her from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning did not see the exhibition personally - just as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacras that are assembled like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also goal-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea like the movement, which was also hiding behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide man-hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who became suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the District Court of Cook County."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A public warning system published by the Police Authority of Chicago states that the dead body was discovered on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">She has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president of university relations, said in an e-mail explaining that Lathem is now in a certificate and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a speaker at the university and Somerville College said in an e-mail explaining that" "we are in contact with the UK police and are willing to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago's Police Administration, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them intensify," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help finding suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"said Guglielmi, the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip stating that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"said Guglielmi, it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents:" "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria cited in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on state-sponsored doping in Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "we are leading the investigation as our anti-doping system has got a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the Independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales office rsports at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"nobody tried to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added. "</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in the course of doping scandals by the WADA."</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"for a good part of the team, these inactive minutes constitute a lunch break."</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19: 15 to meet the already packed schedule of players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood postponed the start of the camp for almost a week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times passed practical exercises in Westwood."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first novel by Rhodes, which is based on an archive: it wrote" Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, "a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the English history, among them 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an upheaval that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knievelli Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes."</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensioners and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as wire-driver of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people who allegedly participated in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since that week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the day after the coup, Erdogan had designated the attempt to overthrow the" "God present", "as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>

<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing" Islamization "of the army, which, among other things, manifested itself in the abolition of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the big-cleaning with the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 state ministers by decree, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they putted under appeal to their role as a guardian of the worldly state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pressed the power of the military step by step, not least with regard to the reform dictations of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan has specifically directed an Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "a particularly non-cited officer, who, after the attempted coup attempt, sought asylum from persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be" full of extremists and salafists in a few years. ""</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are worried about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples up to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a Stepford-woman progressively."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"this Robot Part can be added to a Killstreak Fabricator in creation of a Killstreak Kit."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">RoxxxGold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "in spirit" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards frigid (means here: conflicting) Farrah, disturbing one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy compares with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement indicate a bit darker and shale in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR stops their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what transpires out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until they give permission to the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House, who has boiled to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most awful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing, suggesting independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"or to put it in the phrase" "2017" ": maid service"</seg>

<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>

<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everybody knows which she knows, including the republican relationship with which she struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"the dining table is certainly a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this also entails significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was reinforced by Trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalisation "and Trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that his bibs will no longer meet us someday."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more terrified long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of rationality once compared to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as a very mild criminal offense."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the Carussells of New York's Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurry and the animals spin around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatising music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>

<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the emissions behaviour of cars of emissions categories Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.</seg>

<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">It could be time-consuming to get an appointment.</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"senior researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut pathway to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, capable of dissolving inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the equilibrium tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan mice had in their food, the more they had their immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes a tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease if the same system also invertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immunological cell that favours tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it supposes that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA sequences, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome failed and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and then passed small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unmature immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleansed out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophane levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan outproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophane values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each commune had to carry out the said preventive examinations.</seg>

<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued alongside a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Centre requested the presence of helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the Deputy Marine Corps of Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the Event at 3: 00 p.m. and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the recordings made available to TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal workers to use state owned property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "the commander wrote."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," the Deputy Commandant answered. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of the reform of health reform going on in the Senate and propagated the efforts to curb government rules."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>

<seg id="2740">Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers did not overtake the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual budget."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America," "said Spicer."</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared according to the publication of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the cathedral capellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican paper" Osservatore Romano ", on the other hand, criticised that in reporting of violence in the Domspatzen with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubts that it is about" shameful and shameful acts, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the" degree of media manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"even Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you like to go to the church and this is a prisoner of time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows a completely normal pedagogical means" "had been" "to be done with naughty children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they find it unfair to apply today's standards for decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports of abuse of abuse, often also pope brother Georg Ratzinger appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger included the commemorative volume" My Brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment commissioned by the lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"in a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen, between 1945 and the early 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of over-attacked, 67 Domspatzen are sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that by the Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially at high emotionality, the punishment for the students was even more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to many other accused, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite force, even positive memories are associated with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Heshemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence against protective foals in the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students raise their" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which has been tangible for the latter when a domain record has no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is generally found in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated straight to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside of his sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, it is possible to preject it too late or not have taken the first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents - as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presented an excellent testimony," sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere," "and" "always surrounded by grapes of children". ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which also led to wutches."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only blow up with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also distributed earrings and too cheered guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted, deeply regretted and apologized for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, for his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, it is true to Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it's a question of whether it's not with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many of the media plunged on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope many, who never understood him, are still busy."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot about the issue of abuse was reported in the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put on his final report any involvement or co-ordination with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted himself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said an affected person on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even familiarise themselves with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the scrappings of Ratzinger's role in view of the abuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragile student formulated it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that all of them have opened up to him... more intrusive or clearer, or even more open compared to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that in the run-up, students and / or their surroundings confided, could not be confirmed in the context of the study. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any co-ordination."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not being prevented or being brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as it unfortunately occurred in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "violence excesses" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed with a huge amount of sexual abuse and exviolence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is, namely, clean separate: between the pre-school and the grammar school of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses, as well as, let's say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally schizophrenic and painted, all of them took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most witnesses stress, the topic of" pre-school "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was indeed discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, when the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore even combine positive memories with him in numerous cases despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">This is at most still the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently bade the ears in front of states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out," that in the pre-school the investigational punishment will continue to be practiced. ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time, as legal clarity, as a test punishments were banned in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us is still white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where the afflicted might exaggerate or dramatized and where really the permissible limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the trial penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" fall of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of assessing the past of today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this certainly does not apply to sexual abuse, which was detestable at all times and also not for what was burned in the pre-school of resistance and violence to innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all very terrible, and I am glad that it will finally be worked up."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, that is to draw ear-files and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, it has also kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "returned?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of investigational punishments also available in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, that the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all admit that he was leading a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must once be said: without this perfectionism, without the demands of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trance, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candies alone, one makes no big vocalist and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you see for Georg Ratzinger talking about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger and again and again as wonderful, humorous, graceful, deeply believing and cordial people, of which one can't imagine that he could only hurt a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I come regularly with how many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his emerization, regularly keep contact with him, visit him, read him, he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict heavenly father, certainly, that may be - but nevertheless a lovable respectful person, to which she is still watching her today and which she almost reveres."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clearly: all that you reproach him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that stands behind, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the Anstand would command a 93 year old man who has earned great merits and without anyone outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
