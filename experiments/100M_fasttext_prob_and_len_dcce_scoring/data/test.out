&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , got his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the &quot; &quot; S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters &quot; &quot; said that they were shock@@ ed and destroyed about his death . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia stated that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that , &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;

Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview now un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear .
&quot; I &apos;m always plug@@ ged in drawers or painted from outside label , which mostly have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself have not the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , a TV with a loose de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she asks the question of the desire for children : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with a couple of colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted at home in the fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even shoot himself for photo purposes . &quot;
a long time was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports team handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Gold Sports Pyram@@ id .
awards do not lack the sympath@@ etic sports@@ man .
&quot; German Cross , Silver Lau@@ rel , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ta@@ sted him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he first met Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring for decades .
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold US ma@@ st@@ ers@@ winner was recorded on Saturday into the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ en@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of those sporting legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza price went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy Compar@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP commercial deal - that &apos;s what Clinton and Tr@@ ump want .
&quot; however , the two US pres@@ idents are un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamentally ru@@ ined , rather philosophical . &quot;
of the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt small and war@@ ns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
Clinton wants to tax@@ ing the economy to death and to regulate death he says .
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be completely different , asser@@ ted Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will drive up regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he is strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich are raised , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ dless . &quot;
the democratic candidate at all announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there could be no party @-@ internal discussion . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are clear@@ er .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ operate coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the Trans@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic Trade Agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better then , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics cont@@ end him so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , at least , wants to demand that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
&quot; escape : &quot; &quot; every woman who has fled has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost every day . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women sit .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria , and among other things she deals with the topic women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - even not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons out@@ weigh the flight : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al away secre@@ tly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that is driving them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example ask for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , relates B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , all @-@ standing women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich , trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodation just for them , challenges B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their area of competence , some answered no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of the Govern@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ians , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Francon@@ ia there are some common shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published to the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lacking privacy , or will men and women stay together , it may become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this protection requirement , one can read at the rush that there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands for new work activities
assistant physicians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more employment action from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers failed to address the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; har@@ r@@ ingly quiet &quot; to problems that led the treaty to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requested official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work activities that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute resulted in the fact that this year , Assi@@ enz@@ arians struck six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of B@@ MA &apos;s assistant physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions which had been recommended by B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 physicians and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Citiz@@ ens &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed gre@@ asy and he barely sh@@ one out of heat even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had beha@@ ved like that would never happen . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ turn of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia .
&quot; the crime was even greater , since it was done by a supposed friend . &quot;
building up the Vet@@ r@@ auen is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erd@@ og@@ an who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to make a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was enth@@ r@@ alled by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his ministry last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved if flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it regards reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the slu@@ dge emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ ped to benefit from the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian head of state , in Ankara , secured a bonus that he demanded support for elected government institutions after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that are driven by the West and are badly treated and are now being treated badly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still huge differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both the pres@@ idents at the press conference said they had not even stri@@ ped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally mis@@ led it to answer a question about its differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey pushed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least agree with one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office roll . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumers . &quot;
&quot; it supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national marks into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head@@ quarter and stock exchange notation will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these stamps will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers on these stamps .
R@@ BS has already said that his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer be continued and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board leader . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bench for our customers and would have launched those marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner , D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20.000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ er when he reco@@ vers the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career ie@@ ge &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modernis@@ m and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for the race , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enthusiastic fans for this kind of sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already caught 6,000 wins if he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years in the UK , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible yo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve w@@ re@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month ban , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue on competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin fired Stab@@ s@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin expected to dism@@ iss Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s staff of staff .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the narrow@@ est trust circle of Putin many years ago .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s dism@@ iss@@ al of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without stating any reasons . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , was named his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he graduated at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the emb@@ assy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state with regard to legislative designs and checks to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has taken Moscow secre@@ tly .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov has long been one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest acquain@@ t@@ ances , working as he for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff rec@@ alled their own desire . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at all .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president , who once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to tell me this very complicated post . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , closest ally attacked ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
&quot; Putin became prime minister , before he was elected President three and a half years later . &quot;

puzzles to fish in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fishes around San@@ da@@ ale that were sp@@ elled out by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four clos@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; ceiling fan &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown made a visit to the building site and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic proportions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given today in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure represents future @-@ oriented high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or north side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards in incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; muscle , since the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be still alive
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness still to be alive &quot; &quot; after being thrown away from fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI Res@@ cue station crashed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have blown the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a Bo@@ je hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coast@@ guard boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have good luck and still be alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this sol@@ dered the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has wo@@ ken about these men today .
seriously injured - man puts on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic do@@ er cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police was able to arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed her sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her companion .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old grab@@ bed his sister and grab@@ bed his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Green think : investors should be taken more strongly in the future in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable housing in the coming years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; housing concept living &quot; at the next council meeting .
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; Christoph Brat@@ man said : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built on the farm . &quot;
&quot; however , the big point of dispute in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ man : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but to build as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing as possible . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing subsi@@ dy programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ man says , &quot; There is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder constraints for investors .
&quot; not@@ with@@ standing this , so Brat@@ man , b@@ ole a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; yet the program is not entirely different , because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should anyway be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of around 1300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , so the planning oli@@ tical spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought off @-@ running bonds from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring homes back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
because in the western city exp@@ ir@@ ation dates exp@@ ire at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be found there in price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners to do the housing companies .
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts is not supposed to exist any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play outside , but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens , was su@@ ed by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to vide@@ og@@ ames and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other .
&quot; I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many of the phenomena of pop culture , the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand dropped slightly at the beginning of July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , pursuing 3@@ 5,000 users , the Washington Post recently shared that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of downstream people who train every day 30 minutes , dropped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take &quot; &quot; get away from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are d@@ ull to health and come from people who look el@@ usi@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that makes them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships on hunting .
&quot; as always , there are also game per@@ ish@@ ers , who have to compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
there has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Scher@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bal@@ es is at all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the floor .
all lines are brilliant .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a multi @-@ battle title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ ends on the we@@ ave bar during the individual multi @-@ national competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ fight title , and the fifth , as she consoli@@ dates her reputation , to be the best of her generation , or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as a unique ath@@ lete , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years its sport , 15 world champion@@ ships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou Dog Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she expected her final examination in Brazil , a competition not so much going on between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a last @-@ dimension@@ ed expectation . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; American women Simone Bil@@ es , left and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the multi @-@ tiers of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ jana took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bal@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long path , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ trip in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition competition , a series of victories that will last for a long time as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ afa was easily led by two rot@@ ations , the image d@@ ashed . &quot;
suspended beams and pav@@ ements - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground there was another one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her en@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears poured on fine red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ man was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ afa went . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , which is called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil exercise , she threw into the public kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is concerned , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mur@@ der@@ ous mur@@ der@@ ous mur@@ ders shot in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot who died in one of Phoenix &apos;s most deadly ra@@ ids , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ gun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police informed that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ sight , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at , if they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in eight attacks in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it is done in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; divided Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ in from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that crashed on an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his old age , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I was not allowed to do that .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize her in circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking assistant .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ l up to his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund intended for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him character language , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of a uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rain , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ is@@ iana , Mississi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rain@@ falls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ is@@ iana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday over with more rain@@ falls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south east of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Mississi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ ins , the National weather service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ is@@ iana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards told us that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help the communities affected .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inches in this area to fall in rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while in the area Mobile continues to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ is@@ iana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ded many homes in the area surrounding Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers . &quot;
&quot; the stream Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi State Limit in Liverpool , Lou@@ is@@ iana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams were still dra@@ gging people out of flood in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson districts in the south @-@ west of Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near the Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , has risen overnight strongly . &quot;
he said that another step @-@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a rise of the river in the 48 years , in which she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread quickly , as there were still heavy rain@@ falls and that the authorities are considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil had been significantly su@@ cked by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rain@@ falls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish and educational failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the Chief of the Municip@@ ality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floo@@ ds . &quot;
there were emergency shel@@ ters in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood , and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to participate , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Mississi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ess said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of homes on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ded , but no reported on Friday until now . &quot;
&quot; Kei@@ th Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; smo@@ ked by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered from multiple shot injuries including in the l@@ ende , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has under@@ gone a lot , his small body was blown through balls , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared the transmitter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that it is expected to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also killed : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two cas@@ u@@ alties were not in the car and the police were determined whether one of the injured men could find the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continual battle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; so there seems to be several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently inspec@@ ting the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a ra@@ cket at the arm , when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone to Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic office in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Scher@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catholic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally mirr@@ ored by the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year we were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion@@ ships Simone Scher@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ m@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold in an individual multi @-@ competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t look like gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have four tur@@ ners in the team . also , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymn@@ asts are a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily come into private sports clubs which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , orientation , travel - clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued at any time . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the turbines receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Scher@@ ger , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to help the municipalities in inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy to access exercise . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( mostly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will go to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the olymp@@ ic team gold and thanks , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
veter@@ in@@ arians want to organize other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to stop the dispute over the amendments by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association &apos;s function@@ aries , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7,@@ 000 assist@@ ants voted in elections rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , H@@ unt had exposed plans to introduce the treaty for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of idle times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assi@@ sts , shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; Assi@@ sts have still serious concerns regarding the proposed treaty , in particular that it will inc@@ ite the current availability crisis and leave it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve the disputes through talks with the government must engage in resist@@ ing and sometimes on ear @-@ de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
this was the case of a promise made by Jerem@@ y H@@ unt for the last month that his door would always be open .
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now to raise the condition and address the concerns of the assist@@ ants .
&quot; should he not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work activities . &quot;
&quot; last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to give doctors on the strip post@@ age covering . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to stop the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the British Medical Association function@@ aries .
&quot; B@@ MA wants a better end of the week for the 5@@ 4,000 Regist@@ ra@@ cians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , asked the assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working fight measures do not only reach little but over@@ load teams and service providers and prepare the patient , p@@ ans and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months we talked to the committee of the Assi@@ sts , and with the Ministry of Health as well as other mini@@ stries responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hope that continuing positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , training analysts , mutual recognition of the curriculum , education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the observ@@ ance of agreements with B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; about 14@@ 0,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form har@@ nesses .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots are dissolved , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ log the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the Bri@@ li@@ que trade name , reduces this risk by making blood cl@@ ots less likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of NI@@ CE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of NI@@ CE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft recommendation does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness leaves elections in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report because of corruption out of office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread election dec@@ eption in Muslim communities is unknow@@ ingly ignored as a devast@@ ating government report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , former cabinet member , attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored evidence of abuse due to &quot; intoler@@ ances regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now an Ant@@ kor@@ rup@@ tion@@ king , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of electoral cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a passport , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
currently a vot@@ er has to name his name and address .
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to a person &apos;s finger , if they vote their voting vote to prevent someone to vote twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to church documents and decisions of not official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but should also protect the government from the wider cor@@ rupted and financial fraud that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special tri@@ bunal decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should ab@@ stain after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia alleg@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to &quot; &quot; have guided his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous , or the result of a im@@ itation in which one person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed himself particularly al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - with the older members of the Muslim community pressure made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding expressions to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as proof has been applied that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have ignor@@ antly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning the eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist post letter papers to stop &quot; &quot; re@@ aping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the report taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immun@@ isation and social fraud .
consider choices to ask voters before choosing your ID .
&quot; do not use remo@@ ve@@ able ink on a person &apos;s finger , as soon as she has given up her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
perform systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications on an automatic letter .
ban that political activists deal with full postal elections and envel@@ opes of postal elections .
give the police the power to set up barriers for election stations .
a change of legislation which facilitates an accus@@ ation due to inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( National Council Act 1983 ) .
photography offered in electoral centres .
requirement that only English may be used in the constitu@@ ency stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally asser@@ t that voters alone enter the election cabin .
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed . &quot;
&quot; the election court rejected Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of cor@@ rupted and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty on a number of grounds - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ up control &quot; of the election reviews of the Town @-@ Houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spreading of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic sports@@ men in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are over the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge and band who turned out to be an impressive du@@ k@@ head of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces running on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the Hunter and the Wolf : crew member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack many people pointed out on the internet as a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio might be .
the team member of the US squ@@ ad in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; distributed Bra@@ dy to the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big , expressive eyes is supposed to go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a hall@@ way higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption act@@ ress .
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe eye brow@@ s and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ t@@ ann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian von Fans attacked , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ shape and eyes &quot;
not the only ones : a Twitter User was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter User declared their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US Football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and face . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons encomp@@ ass K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which features her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float died like a pig .
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds Analysis on the fourth place of the 14 year old Ai Yan@@ han at dr . 200m Frei@@ stil@@ ted swimming pool emp@@ tied viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
&quot; Canadian Sender C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was turned off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Free@@ z@@ ine swi@@ ms down his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was picked up in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; excit@@ edly , she went as called M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the s@@ wimm@@ ers 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after shock@@ ed by sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane Twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ in from China &quot; died like a pig &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on the show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the review against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard when many asked him to talk to him .
&quot; Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was , &quot;
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; W@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with the people who responded to the b@@ emer@@ le about Twitter
comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el ap@@ ologi@@ zed to Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers at the show and our followers in social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zing in the program and tried to justify his re@@ mark , saying it was not his intention that it was designed to be a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olympic twist , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the float , not to it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who ta@@ sted in the middle of business sham@@ eless@@ ly under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to see when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
&quot; wor@@ rying about the situation , she numbered her , how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
she cleared up and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the primary store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she turned back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the position , pulled out her own tr@@ ump pants and pants and ta@@ sted her . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , since she put them back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that her didn &apos;t fall , and went out again . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the bott@@ oms that she had ta@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; How do you think that someone would take shelter with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she didn &apos;t get washed .
&quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident which occurred on Tuesday , August 9 , at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been removed from the sale .
how to protect yourself against weapon attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; hit him with the knee in the bar and twist while the att@@ acker cur@@ tail before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while she direc@@ ts the gun to him . &quot;
&quot; at att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and direc@@ ting the gun to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that at a smo@@ ker the saf@@ est thing is to hand over your money , unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right scra@@ ps his tongue at the most dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and stran@@ gl@@ ehold of a serious test - by removing some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dropped off his course on a euro notes , a rail@@ ing button on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before leaving every object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of det@@ aching the flus@@ hing button of a traction toilet , already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his trip through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he ta@@ sted , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by going through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task turned his immune system definitely under a test &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms , and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ escence of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the number of lumin@@ omet@@ res of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its lumin@@ escence was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacterial count in different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have ger@@ o@@ iled in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
&quot; I &apos;m not going to lick here anything , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we w@@ aged crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had spar@@ ked some of the things I had told him , just like the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to blame them and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .

&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left its social housing after a delay with a damage of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing association found ownership in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were gr@@ asp@@ ing holes , wooden pl@@ anks were torn , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she is worried that the apartment is no longer to be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ets , inti@@ mid@@ ation , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ bet , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
they were tra@@ ded in the property where drugs were traff@@ ick@@ ed in the past .
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ated her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
del@@ o@@ ding were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , tomorrow we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have neglected the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house to which the police were called in regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step considering Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horri@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will don@@ ate comfort to some neighbours and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ding on the ground
&quot; workers of house management will now have to dream of rub@@ b@@ ish mountains , which surround the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ on obtained a fine of money after being guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial confidence .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth . &quot;
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti ador@@ ned with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will manoeu@@ vre r@@ enter who do not adhere to the house rules
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told Angela C@@ row that del@@ o@@ ding was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can take self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as to those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a portu@@ g@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air@@ strikes put an unbelievable fall flight &quot;
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was pre@@ cluded &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after a ti@@ flying jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers split up , as they were understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing first what was coming to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ uno Ar@@ ro@@ ja added , &quot; I was just surfing and felt as if the plane would drop me down . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were shifted in panic when the plane came from the darkness and flew incredibly low .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ craft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and thereby had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the speaker said that the jet was slightly deeper than usual due to bad visibility due to bad visibility , but the air@@ strikes continued to ins@@ ist that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible because of the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his vision . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ onn@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time outs they had no coaches . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump destro@@ ys ″ huge problems ″ in campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announces weakness of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi @-@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed such a concern as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own republi@@ can camp from the race , there is now a doubt about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump against evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt is false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media sm@@ iled . &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor compl@@ ained of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not with the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the Senate , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he makes no difference as &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this was fine , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened tr@@ ump to strike funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present any better poll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans wanted to get stronger under the arms for Congress . &quot;
Olympia : three @-@ day Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipline commission .
Kenya athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Un@@ ge@@ mach .
&quot; after a fraud trial in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee was to immediately establish a discipline commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan officials told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine specimen to the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this has been reported to the team leader of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to make their own examinations , shared a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent actions of IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will assess the assessment , &quot; she said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s chief of mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become at Peking WM @-@ fourth more than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich had been with@@ drawn from Rio games .
he is accused of being informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money payments of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was report@@ edly arrested in Nairobi on his return to Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation at IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing @-@ off@@ s for a long time .
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls laid before the Rio Olympics , more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets before the Rio Olympics were noted earlier that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks prior to the Olympics .
&quot; in consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport @-@ type was widespread and systematically magni@@ fied . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic Couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
&quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their speed and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
she rec@@ alls her love with Tony as the younger sister plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; firstly , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enor@@ mously generous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ ju@@ dice and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ertor@@ rique had gone to New York , and the New York City residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were back then . &quot;

&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girl who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria several weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V reported News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pret@@ ended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the east of London rose to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sult@@ anas &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will remain in the case of an electoral victory in Gar@@ land as candidate for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton nomin@@ ates the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Sen@@ at Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference , that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;

&quot; apparently , it is the view that it also does the calendar . &quot;
&quot; we have to return to the exposition of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the Cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass flight
&quot; those who do not adapt and praise Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is forec@@ asting ten thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term it might even become &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the president &apos;s president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard pre@@ hen@@ sion of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the attempted coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had passed Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds earlier months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing from Turkey on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the put@@ sch , there would still be secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of the Association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities . &quot;
thus Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the balance on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the Chief of the Federation demanded that the federal government positions itself as sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers .
&quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics is taking place . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the fire mark as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not adapt and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way , also the Kem@@ alists and saws , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper referred to figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks already placed the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on the date of 30 June , this would have been 11.@@ 386 people and 29 percent of all of them as asylum @-@ holders ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not find themselves in fear of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because more stupid than so far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land warfare - that bit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen , or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate fl@@ yers , distribute fl@@ yers and count voices at the end of the vote are lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; by September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last holiday @-@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass a campaign against itself just close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s . &quot;
it is exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one can see from its large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , as it did already his legendary word @-@ bear@@ er Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
otherwise Seel@@ ions got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Chancellor Merkel the fault of the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if at the wrong time it is in the right place election campaign . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major discoveries ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis lies in the northeast .
&quot; but the target audience did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a pity not to anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely elimin@@ ates the usual election conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and air bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this means co@@ king , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has noted that , in the country , you have to pass on the basis that it has to be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the provinces of the country hardly there . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U election comb@@ at@@ ant co@@ king on his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clearly won by 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , will make the leap into the land day . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of vacation need , and spend their campaign largely on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the chairman Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green elec@@ tive fighters go on track searching for native vocal ch@@ ores among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and ending only at 8@@ pm , there are always praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff about the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the month , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the contrary will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft driving . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was immig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ verband was aboli@@ shed , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation in the place has been relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ verband from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asi@@ ve traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the Deputy Head Director , responsible for the traffic engineering management of the restructuring unit Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were seeking and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that many trucks in residential areas have fr@@ ing@@ ed .
&quot; since the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable ex@@ cess@@ es , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have already been fl@@ ashed .
the fastest speed was at 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is now open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look at the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales collap@@ ses , everyone is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ ership of Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most moderate decline , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that naturally &quot; the running documentation is missing . &quot;
the most heavily loaded are the local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
the sales revenue was &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; street recognition has dropped off its operation &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his associates .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt addressed a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if it could give a financial compensation , with the indication answered , the restaurant profit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , it also has to bear the disadvantages that result from the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot;
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties where a little more gener@@ ously handled .
&quot; for all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less often due to complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else nice . &quot;
&quot; that his lin@@ eage arrives back after the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the greatest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of counter @-@ terrorism law is screw@@ ed to laws .
&quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick@@ ened security package . &quot;
but what has a D@@ ul@@ ant status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur .
&quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not demand anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in this . &quot;
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was in the midst of results and a &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has failed to submit a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but this is all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the un@@ co@@ ded communication , is not new . &quot;
not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities does not come as a surprise .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; said the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; he nevertheless believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything , which in the coalition partner anyway has no chances . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he is planning quick@@ set for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees , which are targeted in the country , should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for security checks . &quot;
&quot; in the event of alleg@@ ations for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some of them are still un@@ balanced and are open to questions .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated - for example - raises the question : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in view of the high refugee numbers , many people worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things , which the people employed deeply , could not cling to the election times either . &quot;
inner security has moved enor@@ mously .
&quot; first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
the EU and the SPD are therefore increasingly standing in position on the issue of internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , it went up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a secret dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also working for con@@ cili@@ atory tones .
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the double @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
we have forged the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish you is not reasonable .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
whether his own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner must be shown .
there is a lot of potential for conflict .
but the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the subject of inner security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to increase security . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen comes back lightly . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide . &quot;
but it does not run in all markets .
in the recall campaign there is vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen is stepping into the second half of the year for deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car @-@ bre@@ wer can forward a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the brand &apos;s core brand weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus poll@@ uted the total sale , as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
in Germany &apos;s home market the deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
&quot; sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , above all on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; have given a purchase restra@@ int . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also deb@@ ated the exit from the EU , a spokes@@ person explained . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the fl@@ ab@@ at@@ ars first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus sign . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected house @-@ brand of the Lower Saxony falls back lightly with the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales plan from January to July .
&quot; at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW confir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after converting a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; certificate to the customer according to the conversion , I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was named on Friday in company circles . &quot;
reasons are legal fin@@ es .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for all @-@ fitted diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Office of Transport .
&quot; from the ministry of transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA full @-@ fle@@ dged enterprise .
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion no deterior@@ ations will take place and all type approval @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not , as it was named in company circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen regards the possibility that customers for example come to a workshop half a year after retro@@ fitting , and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands sent@@ in@@ els in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see in it a signal : normal savings would not have to &quot; be afraid of paying pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when banks make money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank g@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he be@@ ware 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not understand . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; said the head of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter @-@ principle , the costs are now to be paid further . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank &apos;s v@@ aults would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve seen four floo@@ ds , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Bank Council . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the cooperative association Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear alone , be &quot; economically viable not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thuring@@ ian Volks@@ er- and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 made head@@ lines with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Financial Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits nationwide , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is somewhat la@@ vis@@ h@@ ly equipped by the property . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if they take money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ oper@@ atives association Bavaria &quot; are currently no other banks known that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June , the President of the German Volks@@ bank and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not be able to please that in width .
destination plates : who bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lon@@ ely males average age love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section to over@@ see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Am@@ nesty Men &apos;s Not@@ i@@ fication , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multiple resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attribut@@ able to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely caus@@ al group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ de by collecting hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit , before I stop , hold my hands and dict@@ ate something like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly iron@@ ed in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three males middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of units : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20th ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a si@@ zable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and sold items that he sold when he was young and pl@@ ung@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are promp@@ ted to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people have usually dra@@ ined their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a particular age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a store like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores have a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took imp@@ etus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of trusted records , from objects that invoke happy adjustments . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is with me as a collector so and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; bl@@ ur@@ red an employee from a stack of records . &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I am bl@@ ending through a pile of bos@@ sa nova com@@ pil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Keys : three Men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; trophy &quot; of the Revi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ track so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ oriented , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people saying : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who only slowly get back . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has an entertaining audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle age women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ter pop in place of experimental jazz from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely but na@@ othing psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she is making a shopping window rather than buying a shopping bag .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I admit that jeans &apos;s hot pants feature patterns , I watch a group of young teenagers who are group@@ ing Polar@@ oid cameras for a moment , before a father and his daughter think about buying a crossover record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; Platten@@ kunst . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research has yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ loving women exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they ste@@ er the star@@ ring gaze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter , who above the shoulders obli@@ ges obli@@ vious men of middle age . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer about demoli@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which persons within the camp sell goods , sell cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ beverages , sell bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which hold a fire and san@@ ity risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; closure &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two help organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals in the course of summer . &quot;
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the olymp@@ ic period , the professional photographer Tony Martin wants to not get involved . &quot;
&quot; I keep track of the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to tell me to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he had to analyse in peace , which reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le had led . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adjust to the next generation of speed meas@@ urer : in different states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new fl@@ ashes are tested , the temples should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tic acting en@@ forcement tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to re@@ building bridges with temporary Tem@@ por@@ aries , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed . &quot;
a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be collected over several tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mode , the trailer can be used with any car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply ch@@ ew@@ ed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also extingu@@ ish a bullet @-@ proof outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the car@@ ver from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also fl@@ ashing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 copies last year . &quot;
Britain reco@@ vers silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit by a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ stu@@ epp@@ ing , ind@@ ent , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by not too bad silver medals - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the obvious defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the GB@@ s jump off for fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co . , as if you were running in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fought in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; a stock@@ ing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , Jar@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
&lt; b &gt; There is no information available for this album yet !
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the GB still se@@ eded . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans whose fans sang , p@@ aving flags and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle blows , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the UK kick@@ ed out in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing
there will be no more emotion@@ less gold than with those games and that wants what is called .
&quot; from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present when they recru@@ ited to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports who laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ 4 un@@ trained use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected in the manner of trium@@ ph@@ al arch . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no @-@ one lifting the difference and there was no longer able to know whether he would survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and they did .
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment early in 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that is the right concept in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is a challenge but that makes it even bigger .
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , her first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ growing morning with her to talk more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding with their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
Provi@@ denti@@ ally Provi@@ des clarity for 31 years
&quot; the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was named after some time in the original sound in a contribution from the Bavarian Radio Radio .
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Francon@@ ia stran@@ gl@@ ed the purpose @-@ association .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe lo@@ aned &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the association for 31 years , 28 years of it as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , supports about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water delivery contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brunn mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up as a water@@ maker in 1985 and was appointed General Manager of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and initi@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , re@@ building up a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ conditioning of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and I have always res@@ um@@ ed new innovations because water is poll@@ uted and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he lived in real life as a water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own undertaking . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the successful concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia district . &quot;
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was his part praised by the water attend@@ ant Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ ery and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he called the well @-@ construction and re@@ organisation of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the rup@@ ture of the can@@ ister at the church lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the towns could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained only once , because you filled the can@@ ister of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man killed his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him being publicly tra@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; by now , Sven S. could be traveling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lübeck wanted to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ hood or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but it confirmed that man had been killed . &quot;
it is a child mal@@ aria .
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission kom@@ mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from the green electricity subsi@@ dy are from the table .
&quot; in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Sour@@ ces for the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday Edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach the negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a draft agreement with the European Commission following discussions with the Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y is 20 percent . &quot;
but even these are not ex@@ alted in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Steel is Future , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers made massive steel on the global market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers launch price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import @-@ steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have accumulated . &quot;
it is uncle@@ ar how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp &apos;s German industry pri@@ mus remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; la@@ stly , prices would have rather stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to close also the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , some 86@@ 000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a well six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , such as the Steel Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity ordered now went back to the second month in succession . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;

&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her entire life : she was a young girl in the school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she is doing something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people .
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures often dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to voc@@ alize and organize , to be able to rely on the others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; who regularly demands his lungs , does not get out of the powder in everyday life too quickly . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Association of Senior Citiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generation , the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to the everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through song texts and especially melodies , people with dementia suffer from long rec@@ eding events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires a special achievement , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentr@@ ating on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people who live alone , do not just focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one experiences through singing in the choir , means H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I do a long time for something , I will better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he means to have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who is listening when a tone goes next ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found via the internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es h@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a hang@@ over on cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect the reputation of cat babies on adult animals has .
&quot; to their surprise , the males also did not leave the males cold - however they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of cat babies in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; at 10 percent faster , they respond more quickly to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out of the veterinary university and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already figured out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call from small children who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger @-@ arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted differentiated on the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
&quot; they turned out faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls to the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women react more sensitive to inf@@ ants regardless of whether they were pregnant or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warran@@ t was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ür . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , Turkey again takes place an important football match . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul round the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be affected . &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
&quot; in doing so , they do not stop before football . &quot;
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ pt , the prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South @-@ Do@@ ors living in America are now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ pt is supposed to be a suppor@@ ter of the minister of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
&quot; although the emergency situation suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , this has virtually no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an declared the noc@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places throughout the country on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into trailer and opponent Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs of Bes@@ ik@@ tas do not belong to the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; what the door of the Turks is in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or del@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will once again arrive . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as top@@ scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
&quot; in the final game against fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best of the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say good@@ bye in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South by Li@@ g , it only reached sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 races as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ Protect King . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at AC Florence , the apparently bor@@ row@@ ed Gom@@ ez had announced at the time of the coup attempt to return after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after its European vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; club manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but the storm would have to be ready to refra@@ in from about a third of its estimated annual growth of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite D@@ oping , these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin had been locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other ski@@ pped athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who after a dop@@ ing lock had su@@ ed her start right shortly before the games , was mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly plu@@ cked and bu@@ gged on her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
it offered a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scenery : she was still in the hall with a set smile and prov@@ oked her appearance .
&quot; when determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who go to the start in Rio in the Rio Olympics despite D@@ oping past . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had been locked for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times World Champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after having been detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra P@@ erk@@ ovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant agent Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
P@@ erk@@ ovic denied the s@@ wis@@ s intake and was locked for six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ ess .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and had been banned for 21 months . &quot;
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible for mut@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ed , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete had so many medals det@@ ained afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
the also recognised bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was returned due to a judgment of the International Spor@@ ting Tribunal in CAS .
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world premi@@ er and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 year old World Champion , evidence was found for taking a banned dietary supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran away already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , said Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; I suffered from cutting cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I have left this again . &quot;
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from other explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ alter@@ in was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , while another person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police &apos;s instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon , demanded several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; said Military General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but it is likely to deal with the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret evidence of imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country , although they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still be uncle@@ ar what group behind the attacks st@@ edge .
&quot; the police told their officials all over the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are again and again smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the former bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) landed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travel will be dis@@ cour@@ aged into these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution issued by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; j@@ un@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to hin@@ der chaos while the country pursu@@ es stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , with@@ drew himself to have led the Kingdom to stability and order again . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok at a stop in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; &quot; is advised by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said constitutional protection officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aßen of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; loss of own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; &quot; identity @-@ bears &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the decision , Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely aligned with the offices of the state . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it is , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to talk to them with a youth @-@ just language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ans &quot; &quot; of Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot;
&quot; as Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any insights . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , potential contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - changes its target direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have stated in recent years that there can be legal @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other legal @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee shei@@ k@@ hs or attacks from other far @-@ right motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of leg@@ ality is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; they vo@@ iced concern about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people , who previously did not appear in the right scene . &quot;
this is the cause of concern .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects of attack on asylum shel@@ ters were previously not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimin@@ als or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised itself by far @-@ right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympic Games or World Records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight float from Ethiopia is so slow that it was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a return of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ represented countries better known .
&quot; since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media portra@@ yed him as &quot; ro@@ bel of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity belly &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meter Fre@@ estyle , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ zz@@ er from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to start alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

post rises to trade with electrical transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
&quot; in a nut@@ shell , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been testing whether to sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ ot@@ ers , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other factories . &quot;

&quot; Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly , and in the long run made it a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we surround the whole fleet .

&quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen even after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder becomes un@@ steady at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that were the case at BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; it was called . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss of loss in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the same level as the prior @-@ year quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros . &quot;
the profit in the second quarter was above all imp@@ acted by the un@@ paid value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
&quot; the good@@ will de@@ preci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros . &quot;

accidents - Bus stops in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate from a vice @-@ driven vice , which was partly on the counter @-@ track . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ person for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident town on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the unforgettable travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the expert witnesses and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic metre of sewage amount from October 1 , 2016 for the area of sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ th@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.10 euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will be increased once more , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an excessive calculation , the sewage charges in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that , when appro@@ ving the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach Land@@ rats@@ saal , Kul@@ mb@@ ach realised that under@@ coverings have been used for these wast@@ ewater facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal grounds , Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ covering manner . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from the town of Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to step deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt pointed to the panel , a new calculation of the fees for the wast@@ ewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 can also be compens@@ ated for over@@ - and under@@ covers from the previous calculation period .
&quot; in addition , Schmidt founded the engraving fee increases in all three wast@@ ewater plants by relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ewater treatment , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the sewage volumes in all three plants are slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expendi@@ tures in all three plants , the period of recovery and repair expendi@@ tures in all three systems declined significantly . &quot;
&quot; the complex in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for the th@@ igh@@ s , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant had to be replaced due to a damage .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be repaired , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es of the sewage slu@@ dge and an additional ventilation option can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came to the continued care and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully integrated in the three plants .
&quot; as a result , Schmidt added that the market community had spar@@ ed large entertainment costs in the wast@@ ewater facilities in the past 20 years . &quot;
the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious after the view of stone houses in the long run as one cannot expand the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach Valley sewage plant for these facilities because it is defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % have been charged .
the annual average duration of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a rise in price increased by the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and foot@@ wear ( 2.2 % ) ; Mobili@@ ar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as a Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat states that this filter is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are inde@@ b@@ ted , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ fies each day . &quot;
all mis@@ carri@@ ages reach the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have taken criticism in the past where they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when it struck a filter this week , which gave them s@@ lot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and dar@@ ker che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have turned off the feature . &quot;
the company had an excuse : the filter was intended as a hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter reminded of vulnerable cli@@ ches . &quot;
others decided to reject the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote in an e @-@ mail , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et about the photos became widespread that the filter was &quot; &quot; vulnerable &quot; &quot; and was un@@ pleas@@ antly said . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contra@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face was pulled into the scor@@ ching extrem@@ ity . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dragon .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s large audience of young people - who are different in terms of race than their older counter@@ parts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ chat &apos;s filters generates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than before , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and urged others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rac@@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the partly white , only male leadership , and terminated its essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; the company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as a private company . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company recently set up a personnel responsible focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; in turn , Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military Gu@@ idance Re@@ duc@@ es IS@@ IS Intelligence Information , Pres@@ ents Committee of Congress &quot;
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a task force of the Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ can members of the Ar@@ med Forces Committee , Intelligence Committ@@ ees and the defense budget committee , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command Secret Service analysts , who reported how superi@@ ors changed their appreciation to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , typically fu@@ cked by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , reported on a regular basis a positive image of American efforts against terrorism , as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were generally positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; noted Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leaders in Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed uncer@@ tain@@ ties in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced the pressure of their predecess@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command &apos;s press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; presented . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them , that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while investigations continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments for IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; the highest @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; Dam@@ aged the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats gave up , not having found evidence of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts as regards a &quot; &quot; definite political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , which were received after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year rejected the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State was reminiscent of dis@@ divisions of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush pre@@ viewed only a small crew of troops in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker confirms that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , these temporary refin@@ eries would have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the USA win four @-@ th match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead &quot;
&quot; one day after she fired three gates across Japan during a 6 @-@ 1 victory , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , they know : the American female are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same time in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man slightly longer from the path that leads to the other group .
&quot; whatever the game is going on on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the National Team , began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work floor in London that we now have .
we have been able to completely rip off the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a flash@@ back from the close @-@ up area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and l@@ up@@ ed the ball to the goal to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; surrounded by the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistently and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the tri@@ ath@@ lete to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting queu@@ e in the coff@@ e@@ eshop without hearing about Simone Scher@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is involved for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s black with dimples , would certainly have been under these famous names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsor@@ ing and well @-@ being TV commerci@@ als , if it were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , some in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I don &apos;t have enough arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it has been so spar@@ ingly noticed for the last 16 years that many people I had asked , didn &apos;t know that it is an olymp@@ ic sport at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to a competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 had a athletes who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Medal this year .
&quot; jumping on a trampoline has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the car@@ cin@@ ogenic trem@@ or of his never @-@ ending wake @-@ up - but also the gra@@ zie of exercising and diving , the two sports that it essentially un@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means much like &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ ts ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; you will be judged according to the official Olympic program after execution , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ ons must go further , faster , up and down , sometimes down to the finish , sometimes down and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the output wall , but in television transmission also another ridi@@ culous goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel myself looking at when watching these games .
the trampoline offers an breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
&quot; he or she bo@@ unces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon blo@@ c on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the spru@@ ce and obj@@ ecti@@ fication of male athletes , according to the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey wa@@ its for air rin@@ gende , new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators call for political changes in Ethiopia to attack the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country , and in more and more areas far@@ ed out . &quot;
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was cruel . &quot;
witnesses reported that police officers shot and killed on thre@@ es@@ core un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security professionals strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Committee is calling for a more detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; in Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely together with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; although Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options besides prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints covering everything from land use up to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ critic@@ ised vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ chi Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of becoming fl@@ atter@@ ing beneath the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , because cheap smart phones were becoming more and more frequent and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate over Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they were so protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but this too is changing .
&quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , who account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly versi@@ fied to detect early signs of dis@@ content and use special officers to manipul@@ ate enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime l@@ acks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ si@@ ghted reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tig@@ ers .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of protests prot@@ ested , which , according to the figures of analysts , were seemingly fu@@ cked by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last few months and this time of distur@@ ban@@ ces went over relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ arities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , run by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the mi@@ tig@@ ates becomes more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests are the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently ha@@ st@@ ened that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ice walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump on Friday attempted to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would not have meant the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State . &quot;
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication abilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate if he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ si@@ bly with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his comrades , who endeav@@ or to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of declar@@ ing statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election rally on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump hon@@ ed in relation to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted on suggest@@ ing that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism bo@@ asted down Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling poll@@ s on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he with@@ drew a strong criticism when he said the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course I mean sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction drops . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , which monitors the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted a more et@@ ched tone , as his survey values continued to decline . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ olog@@ ise for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while focusing on the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought out his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how provo@@ king his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ cess@@ ors , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s correctness , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ banks , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread itself by preventing the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and presented them on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who tried to understand him and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats laugh@@ ed at Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ologies as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; once again pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fake cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie business , which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people mour@@ ned for the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel Ex@@ cluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it is also new finding . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly bad atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and manager of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide money for a new foreign office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
verb use the same Distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ den@@ ers like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ans .
there are natural t@@ eller keys .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived previously in William@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take her way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she got a little bit of coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing b@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing b@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no gru@@ dge over the fact that the soap business took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to produce a special soap for clubs with the coffee of coffee in the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he proposed to leave them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed cup of coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favorites .
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the restaurant and the cl@@ adding felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a cop@@ ious meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; tra@@ ded the Chinese kitchen in the USA during Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ k@@ elling snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive trees , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter questioned Hack@@ ney , she found the couple in favour of a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ anu@@ ts , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts that they serve them for dinner .
co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cook for male fel@@ ines and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country moved with it to no longer be the country of the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and K@@ asser@@ ole were stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ producing food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; as chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which has been the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar bl@@ ends have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing gr@@ ati@@ fication had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country such as . &quot;
&quot; by published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary politicians &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical treats . &quot;
&quot; especially tasty , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ year @-@ old man of the world to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a Smo@@ king .
he was very realistic in reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to entr@@ ust an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ c@@ rites of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt did that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book , for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wast@@ ing food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot;
there was a shortage of wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared by Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a misch@@ iev@@ ous trick , modest recipes to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped a little rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly into the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E won a follow @-@ up three times .

he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people alive . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses , and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the toxic remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ ra@@ e is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ y usually only comes to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ y only grows with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai swi@@ ms down at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; however , this lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a bullet for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; anyway of a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifetime , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed that Greenland ha@@ y will be st@@ oned . &quot;
only lack@@ ed evidence .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ y is hard to observe , finally they mainly live in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ y .
&quot; her time pupils measure her , when she equi@@ ps six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bears . &quot;
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver that tor@@ ped@@ oes from higher water layers .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest 502 cen@@ timeter measure . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens occurs already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s when atomic weapons attempt to trigger larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers of length , the lens on the other hand contains a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could classi@@ fy an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years , Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this should also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; also the record holder , a 211 year old Greenland wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was plug@@ ged into a 120 @-@ year old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on flame . &quot;
they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources into a long life . &quot;

&quot; with relief , the board accepted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported living areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the plots , plots and closing questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on surve@@ ying , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - Phase 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and dec@@ eit@@ ful sen@@ iors in equal measure .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ lig will be able to report to the City Hall from now on , by awar@@ ding the par@@ c@@ els , the Municipal Council is expected to discuss in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also meet requests for reloc@@ ation of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Lower @-@ time lar@@ n , the commercial area has already been extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses from London can be operated from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have previously been given approval in the UK . &quot;
that is why large US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; is expecting 10,000 new jobs in the Main in five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg still covers a large fund industry , but also makes Dublin worse in infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has an easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial property . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the mort@@ g@@ ages for first @-@ class commercial real estate mobili@@ ses by 50 percent higher than on the Main River . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the business consultancy Mer@@ cer the city stands at number 7 , Luxembourg in number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researcher . &quot;
&quot; in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. District Ju@@ dge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc . claims to refund the legal costs that you have created from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a damages deposit of $ 200 million for violation of two patents filed in Mer@@ ck , which covered in connection with block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ beh@@ or and other non @-@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; at survey of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction of costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to mig@@ rate to Gilead that has ma@@ stered the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck began to su@@ e each other and took possession of laboratory work , which as@@ par@@ agus of Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;

Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton released her tax return on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton gave rise to USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publishing house for their ten@@ ure in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective German tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hero Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ actors in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law on account of this . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check due to tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election hero Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s special advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspec@@ tions were not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already for@@ vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions concerning wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his deal@@ ings and various other connections , in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already top@@ pled on the topic and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking rep@@ ublic@@ ans call to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke the subject also during a speech to the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or little taxes for two years during the 1990s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed an industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also under@@ gone a tax check of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; Fear &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clinton , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s tax declaration showed that these only USD 100 of their income were paid as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ illi . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved effective and the Honey@@ well Foundation , who already had the idea for years , intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the US nature protection by trained volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is a pupp@@ y day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without harm the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ well Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps cover the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;

a touch is usually already off to hunt the elephant .
&quot; one last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er that sho@@ ots a gold mo@@ ist into the air , causing a loud , light explosion . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; call - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uprising , after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski Brist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not listed an Israeli pre@@ fix since it had requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Brist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s electoral list . &quot;
&quot; the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is it possible that Israel was eliminated and destroyed ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Brist@@ ol offers a possibility to select Israel using its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel indicated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is cancelled , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
there is no need for explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response from the internet in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have im@@ itated the supposed temp@@ est@@ ation of Arab guests .
&quot; ashamed of you , it was in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly indicated all the exc@@ uses and called the incident a &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter into the hot@@ dial list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police Est@@ abli@@ sh Tr@@ än@@ gur@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mis@@ esch@@ ke against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government reforms for the public education system .
the police took tear gas and rubber bul@@ ls against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the fact that the police interven@@ ed rubber @-@ sho@@ ots and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the govern@@ ors of the federal state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the demonstr@@ ators saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters arrived in crowds on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismis@@ sed from office by a vote by the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in business in the country , shared the ambassador . &quot;
Russian enterprises take up existing links with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial break was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian emb@@ assy announced around 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with regard to the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
wanted : bot@@ tling beverage market in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening was exer@@ ted on the Re@@ we XXL beverage market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the rule of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed their faces were asked by the staff of the beverage market to release cash and subsequently fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the offen@@ ders should have been between 1,60 m and 1.70 m tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly observ@@ able .
&quot; the perpet@@ rators must be stra@@ dd@@ led in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel parking place situated opposite the parking house entrance , may be escaped with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y case should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days , the children and young people of the socio @-@ peda@@ gog@@ ical Day Group / Social Group work of the children &apos;s welfare bun@@ ny Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers at their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet area of the Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ len , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the string z@@ oos .
&quot; to the other after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and pl@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers with their own prepared body@@ boards such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spo@@ iled . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , beautiful gem@@ s made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people laugh@@ ed satisfac@@ tor@@ ily . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ ting @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were accomplished . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next romantic pilgrimage of all ministers in the next two years , the top minister of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one decided finally for the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m goal was offered to the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt were on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Par@@ ish Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and informed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was taken . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts in the morning and in the evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches always stir@@ red up again and again to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the local parish priests were at their disposal . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we continued via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the day after this was the leg to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first around 500 metres of altitude , however , had to be climbed . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage church in the imposing church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Mun@@ ster Mun@@ ster in the late afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert on the pilgrimage destination . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ks home , as Bri@@ t Gold for cycling &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , which had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympics medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London rail World Championships in London despite the res@@ ign@@ ation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ e Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when they appeared .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap which K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y , who were victorious four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner compet@@ ed in the qualification rounds an Olympic ch@@ ord , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , Hin@@ der was barely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which it went into a higher gear to slow it down , and to allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des as they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys pointed out that after a weak start he fell away on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such a superior victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une such as London . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 Tit@@ les both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ drome .
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were also born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the case of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next to the Sprint that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
&quot; they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the end . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will be in focus . &quot;
&quot; he had fought yesterday with officers before the qualification , when they called him officials to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team will rely on his strong railway team to dominate the mid @-@ season of the Olympic Games and get a Sch@@ ar of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; drama was played in the background , such as the res@@ ign@@ ation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April , in the midst of S@@ exis@@ .com and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ es and the retirement of magnit@@ u@@ des such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like that the now legendary Call GB@@ s , who has reached its climax at the perfect moment , will again be repeated . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - are at stake , as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract so that all supply contracts will be lifted as the supplying energy company hur@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the Victoria government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ places - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting pot consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa finished the point Henry Mel@@ ting , which led to a closure of Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation on the future of the plant , originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar , and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mold with its Lo@@ y Yang A power@@ plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp. hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt &quot; , &quot; the company shared . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging operations &quot; &quot; that should come into effect from November 2016 . &quot;
contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that the value of the contracts had already written down in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; expectation of a dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the melt or to ensure power supply to the melt &quot; is not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have come into effect from November this year even if it is still a declaration of explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land Mel@@ ting Factory in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and went to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , scann@@ ed reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z on@@ c@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , ending with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d act of almost every birthday sep@@ ia of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , what the vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is rather similar to a visual book than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ ter 6@@ 15 pages ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of its cover stars is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still se@@ eping through the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good snap@@ shot video ( even if everything applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did named them &quot; &quot; Mist@@ stück des Augen@@ bli@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these feelings co@@ ded again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover .
but to go around on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her leisure time she is to be seen in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal utilities annually show 16@@ 0,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies are rejected annually by the local law centres while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mi@@ cuts on over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and the like - have been dismis@@ sed for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the Director of the Community Council of North Fri@@ esland James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community law centres revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would be even worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s communities are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who rely on violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and de@@ pressing debts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by divisions , workers who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this elevation shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the federal government will shor@@ ten the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Office of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately stop these mid @-@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of local communities and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump electoral campaign accused of claiming a gun
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ activity after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a fire@@ arm to an employee in February , while she was in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident was described in an indictment , filed on Wednesday at Charlotte Bord@@ ino &apos;s Regional Court , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ino admitted to have been waiting for months , that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and rested the race at Vinc@@ enti@@ er &apos;s Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ino gave in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after compl@@ ying with the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ oni observed that at least four other persons had had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; Bord@@ ino added . &quot;
&quot; the indictment is only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate prov@@ oked an uph@@ eav@@ al when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; should take action , if his Ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U losing
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are notable for the SPD and CD@@ U government partners . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 per cent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party narrow@@ ed only just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented in parliament with 19 percent for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ uc@@ tant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.8 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in parliament with 3 percent each .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of euros , fans can still buy the devices on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; &quot; Büro in West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ formate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator could be reached . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible via an HTML browser if also tor@@ mented slowly .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was € 3@@ 92 in 2015 .
no @-@ one could susp@@ ect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story even though not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phone @-@ division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft . &quot;
today the market ma@@ stered suppliers that all came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , that is today for very many people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smart phone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion units sold have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies are coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : one music player , a phone and an internet communication , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , and today the iPhone is the group &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; eventually , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the seeds now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we must learn all to get away the smartphone once again , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Executive Board responsible for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we ran a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too large . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we &apos;ll be blin@@ king on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong also at He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for a single infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to a swe@@ at@@ y growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which implemented a £ 11 bn investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time that we will direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ zeiger &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to b@@ ypass ad block@@ age , a &quot; cat and mouse play &quot; is the same for companies that earn money with online advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block public@@ ity in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the encoding regarding its advertising advertisements to make it difficult to detect indicators on which part of the page advertising is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ gger , Ad@@ block Ben Williams spokes@@ man wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the an@@ zei@@ ci@@ zing Open Source Community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display blo@@ wers &quot; and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying display blo@@ wers have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use indicator lo@@ op@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook using their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has been using ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
advertisement on Desktop PCs accounts for a large amount of revenue so Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update his &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Tool &quot; , &quot; in order to have more control over the adverti@@ sed advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the issue , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ person in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt agent , so we instead concentrate on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman driving on Swiss motor@@ ways in case of suspected suicide
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday drow@@ ned by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss did not want to kill himself at the age of 49 years , which was over@@ powered by several vehicles , including a truck . &quot;
she died on the ground .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police told them and each of the witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a colli@@ sion prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases , where a person was running in the dark on the motorway , it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent murder after having crossed a man and killed a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was un@@ conscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate @-@ model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabited once . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have revealed similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly revol@@ ved . &quot;
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turn of Venus expon@@ enti@@ ates its day@@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was presum@@ ed by Plan@@ etary Res@@ ear@@ chers .
&quot; although it was presum@@ ably hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years - exposed too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
its oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burnt away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their Hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect , Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
&quot; on Thursday , Patrick Roy returned to the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations and led to a low level of co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; as an alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic , this decision confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; in the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy has won the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he conducted the club on 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the low season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of five points behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take talks again , put strike &quot;
&quot; the labour disputes regarding the remun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are exposed , while all disputes for a new round of discussion sit down at the table , said negotiations leaders . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shor@@ tened the rates of its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent because of negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .

Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ y@@ aden
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ dre@@ tel@@ teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates under the stars of the con@@ stellation of P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star stu@@ b rotate to different rates , as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational dreams are associated with the planet creation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star@@ es , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which were created some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood . &quot;
you are now on the quick@@ est way .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars colli@@ de with large amounts of star@@ winds . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star climbs , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by det@@ ecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star ch@@ equ@@ es -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower than smaller pi@@ rou@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so near , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us , we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang out their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades of P@@ lei@@ ades in three newspaper reports that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star joins
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eb@@ all Star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year old prof@@ ane will be wearing the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; , &quot; &quot; declared the All @-@ Star @-@ Game of the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was ranked as the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him $ 27 million annually . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es created some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eb@@ all players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be absorbed in the hall of the bas@@ eb@@ all . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was entitled to &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; to have died between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games in the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect to have received high @-@ performance funding through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time south@@ ward . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends have once again received the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympathy @-@ friends of the Y@@ ank@@ ee ore riv@@ alling Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ red : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
an enligh@@ tened ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing incidents have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - just before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these news come to the present time . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a mes@@ meri@@ zing agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International sports court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old covered the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , just for 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the courses over 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will work with the International sports court CAS and accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C but the CAS for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio the news about the positive rehear@@ sal took place at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; declared the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act as an EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample was already positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported his criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for instance , all the wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier positively to the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had banned the whole Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , and Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the earlier trials in China had also taken care of violent confron@@ tations among athletes . &quot;
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a debate with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said he . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 with the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de gro@@ uting h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing businesses - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
40 percent of the victims were willing to take advantage of the solutions demanded by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the cont@@ ested systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is much higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to corporate att@@ acking was sc@@ ary in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once activated on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ modified files such as Word , Excel or Database files , as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als last@@ ingly .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; in order to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users are the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
many hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of sick acts .
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , it only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure examined the user areas and the contact with the users and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually attempting to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or encryp@@ t for free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and will private people rede@@ em for payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; considering the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become increasingly professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the presses are then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal , and commis@@ sions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per infected host .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then use sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful app@@ rais@@ al , the perpet@@ rators will instead thre@@ aten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the potential for damage depends on the type of data even more often than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the offen@@ ders could fully accept new goals on the Internet of things . &quot;
&quot; on the Def@@ con Chi@@ pper Conference , security researchers demonstrated how to get an Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating system could well be a ran@@ som value . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators are then blocking a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini van . &quot;
&quot; sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V works rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work ti@@ ghtly at any point . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior space are well finished and work comfortably , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling down there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with up@@ turned back rests available , but the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; are available . &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a swing chair and thus offer storage space , which is from the floor to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should do a little qui@@ eter to his work . &quot;
the average daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; in the top variant &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems belong to the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the colli@@ sion warning system and the lane support assistant . &quot;
&quot; the colli@@ sion war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because of the maneu@@ ver@@ ing many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed if necessary .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , smartphone integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel starting at 23@@ 000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in case of haz@@ ards that are typical for aviation .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
illness : when the Organ@@ izer pays
&quot; after their journey , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is du@@ bi@@ ous in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely affected by di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of its door@@ way . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family believed that the trip was flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er did not know about it shortly before the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by hiding among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worry about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be owned and determined at the same time acting on terror .
surely it is : our country will not respond to the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
we won &apos;t give this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if criminal offen@@ ders have to leave the country more quickly , this will increase security and strengthen the support of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 parliamentary election .
&quot; he also announced another personal reinforcement of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ sized order of magnitude over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be pun@@ ish@@ able again .
&quot; video surveillance is designed to improve the right of weapons , so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet becomes more difficult . &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated sweat obligation for doctors should be maintained to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how to reduce the risk of citizens , he said , with a view of mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers appropriate social care necessary . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
it is important that the minister of the Interior clearly spoke against activ@@ ism .
&quot; this was a pinn@@ acle for the char@@ ters in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a ban on Bur@@ ka and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
&quot; under constitutional law , he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear . &quot;
one cannot for@@ bid everything that one re@@ jects and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green Princip@@ al Simone Peter designed the Minister to simul@@ ate energy and action with the new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet jumping and tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway junction
it regularly st@@ alls on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right @-@ hand treatment should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers , who stand in traffic on the ambient road every evening in the traffic jam , when they drive through the auto@@ bahn &quot; &quot; Zu@@ br@@ inger &quot; &quot; ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße the right lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from Hammer Street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is spl@@ itted early , thus improving the overall workflow on the multi @-@ rail section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district &apos;s &quot; &quot; Münster @-@ West &quot; &quot; district . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder makes the driver nervous above all between 17 and 19 .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return to the bridge passes through the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the needle tube on the B 51 is shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street . &quot;
from here the traffic is directed only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt more than three @-@ three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated parking lot continue , the relevant state of affairs cannot be said . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to expect : the bridge has an official remaining time to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal subscription period , the state has deliberately chosen the weaker due time during the school holidays because with disabilities is expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday on the building site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Offers for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years attended the production in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; between September 2015 and March 2016 , most of the young people from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria have come to Münster and we@@ aken little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ ers@@ Wester@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will receive the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical translation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association counts with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ bu@@ ffs : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star schn@@ u@@ ppen River Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night for Friday a rich through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain , to observe the heavenly spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .

relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you w@@ ander around etern@@ ally , at night you can awake for hours , in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep long before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ gery and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an on@@ e- and sleep@@ y disorder . &quot;
&quot; just the falling asleep feels many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication . &quot;
in@@ frequently sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is frequent above all for depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are mutually dependent .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ akes up every two or three hours , and perhaps starts to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised by the day , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es we@@ eß . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , tired , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any sleep medi@@ ator in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should contact the family doctor first , advis@@ es we@@ eß . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; for the examination in the sleep labor physician , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in case of illness fatigue , in case of in@@ som@@ nia , or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; only do not make a mid@@ day fight , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the c@@ abling , you go to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can affected people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws to make for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ eping counts on : regular sleeping and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleep , stop drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to have with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first met with gold at the Doh@@ a short @-@ way Championships in Doh@@ a , while at the same time exhibited his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler wants to protect himself from his ex @-@ team mates via Facebook protected from his criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium and a j@@ unk of € 150,000 should no one wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in swimming is bad , whereas the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate in the issue of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly the case with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS of Independent Controll@@ ers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; demands the choice of Hamburg who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot;

the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and luggage theft .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognised a gang in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport , which was known to the police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were passi@@ on@@ ately , mach@@ ined and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the Speci@@ alists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove the th@@ iev@@ es , which had been submitted to Germany to cover criminal off@@ ences , and demonstrate four acts . &quot;
&quot; they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , meanwhile a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stones : the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem so at first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you walk along the road from east to west , you pass play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , it is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new flats . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be illustrated in recent weeks , however , with burning autom@@ obil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants rented lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has expressed itself several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June , on the ground floor , the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , report@@ edly pat@@ rolling official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers pulled out under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who raised three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the building projects , they share the concern of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for majority police protection from the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator and the Police make up between house owners and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them nearly the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the R@@ ī@@ ga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was carried out under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the R@@ ī@@ ga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and choice makers from all over the world : with them residents from GDR times and former home owners share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on tap@@ ed discs or newly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown with paint bags .
no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences are making break@@ through@@ s , which tend to hit the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were certainly not . &quot;
also the famous burning cars can no longer be there in Riga anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously dra@@ gged into the Riga street - and stayed .
&quot; that is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings that crowd the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are actually con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well @-@ du@@ ped , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never list@@ ens ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for additions that anno@@ y themselves about color bombs , K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub district , can compl@@ ain bad about noise there . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on the ground .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social peda@@ gog@@ ical support the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the honorary powers are more than grateful that Deu@@ schl@@ ager is there now , the ze@@ al@@ ous wool mel@@ ee , which has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , a ze@@ al@@ ous Woll@@ mi@@ ch@@ sau lies . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organising , working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has affir@@ med a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the delivery .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential premises .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Office of Agriculture to Commun@@ e and Job Centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work so far , whether you rely on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , char@@ itable apartments must be vali@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be installed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed p@@ ests , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be cham@@ fer@@ ed or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help house master@@ pieces , do non @-@ profit work - and that is motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so we need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here management and honorary officers jump here .
it is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it takes time and can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who some@@ time develop the feeling he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems also , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two of the recent incidents fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk could and may not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents were also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would complete them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; Reg@@ ine says . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they have always been in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politicians are afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar searched with helicop@@ ter

they fled the direction of the city .
