<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with a couple of colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted at home in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he left himself with his family about the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even shoot himself for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">A long time was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports team handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Gold Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">Awards do not lack the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"German Cross, Silver Laurel, Champions Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already tasted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he first met Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "for it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting the offspring for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-fold US masterswinner was recorded on Saturday into the" Hall of Fame of German Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, der Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockenöhle and posthum the handball Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of those sporting legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price went."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP commercial deal - that's what Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidents are unequivocally involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamentally ruined, rather philosophical."</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep in doubt small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to taxing the economy to death and to regulate death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be completely different, asserted Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive up regulators massively, and he is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich are raised, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost wordless."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate at all announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could be no party-internal discussion."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-operate coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand renewables with its investment programme:" a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the Transspazific Trade Agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better then, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics contend him so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, at least, wants to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing alone, almost every day."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious in the room with big eyes.</seg>

<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the area manager of Condrobs, a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria, and among other things she deals with the topic women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentral accommodations for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs worked together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope-makers," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons outweigh the flight:" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example ask for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany, irre, relates Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, all-standing women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich, traumatized, appreciates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experienced, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodation just for them, challenges Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their area of competence, some answered no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in shelters of the Governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabians, escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are some common shelters or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately by men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published to the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lacking privacy, or will men and women stay together, it may become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this protection requirement, one can read at the rush that there is on the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant physicians have called upon their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its entire Council to approve more employment action from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that the ministers failed to address the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Citizens"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed greasy and he barely shone out of heat even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved like that would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downturn of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the crime was even greater, since it was done by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the Vetrauen is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the allegations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was enthralled by a failed coup d "état of almost his ministry last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, as it regards reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing resentment on the sludge empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is piped to benefit from the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian head of state, in Ankara, secured a bonus that he demanded support for elected government institutions after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray" "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that are driven by the West and are badly treated and are now being treated badly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still huge differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both the presidents at the press conference said they had not even striped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally misled it to answer a question about its differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey pushed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least agree with one another."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it is (in Russian) that he later became the Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment," "Thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state with regard to legislative designs and checks to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken Moscow secretly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest acquaintances, working as he for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"during a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff recalled their own desire."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at all.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president, who once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said" "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to tell me this very complicated post."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, closest ally attacked ally, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Putin became prime minister, before he was elected President three and a half years later."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closings of the" "ceiling fan", "which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today, Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the building site and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic proportions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the entire deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given today in Rosyth for the deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or north side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards in incline of approx. 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Green think: investors should be taken more strongly in the future in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable housing in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD suggests a "housing concept living" at the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Christoph Bratman said:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built on the farm."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big point of dispute in the town hall is, however, as Bratman:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but to build as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing as possible."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal housing subsidy programme, which will cost millions and is still to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratman says," There is no agreement between the fractions at the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder constraints for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"notwithstanding this, so Bratman, bole a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program is not entirely different, because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should anyway be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of around 1300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, so the planning olitical spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought off-running bonds from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring homes back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"on one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city expiration dates expire at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be found there in price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners to do the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, it is removed from the goal of the so-called mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts is not supposed to exist any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"president Holger Herlitschke comments:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have concentrated on more sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise can still be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play outside, but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens, was sued by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to videogames and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I am referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many of the phenomena of pop culture, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand dropped slightly at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person puts back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, pursuing 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently shared that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of downstream people who train every day 30 minutes, dropped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take" "get away from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day", "because many public messages are dull to health and come from people who look elusive."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, that makes them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also game perishers, who have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone to Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine under the women's olympic office in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been with every summer olympiade since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Scheres, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirrored by the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female gymnast was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year we were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world championships Simone Scheres, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth heterosexual American, who won gold in an individual multi-competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we are experiencing the top of this sport, but we don't look like gymnastics in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic team will have four turners in the team. also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnasts are a more expensive sport and Turner primarily come into private sports clubs which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, orientation, travel - clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued at any time."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these associations, the turbines receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Scherger, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to help the municipalities in innumerable, young girls that are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy to access exercise."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"for my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will go to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by holding the olympic team gold and thanks, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers had hoped to stop the dispute over the amendments by accepting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association's functionaries, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants voted in elections rejected him."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in July, Hunt had exposed plans to introduce the treaty forcibly and said that the NHS was in a" "Niemandsland" "and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the first assistants are supposed to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of idle times."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assists, shared last night in a communication with:" "Assists have still serious concerns regarding the proposed treaty, in particular that it will incite the current availability crisis and leave it to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">"only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks with the government must engage in resisting and sometimes on ear-deafening silence."</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the case of a promise made by Jeremy Hunt for the last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jeremy Hunt has to act now to raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistants.</seg>
<seg id="10">"should he not do this, the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work activities."</seg>
<seg id="11">"last strike at the end of April saw a replenishment of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to give doctors on the strip postage covering."</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to stop the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the British Medical Association functionaries.</seg>
<seg id="13">"BMA wants a better end of the week for the 54,000 Registracians who are subject to the contract."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Daniel Mortimer, General Director of the NHS employee, asked the assistants to end the strike."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mortimer said:" "working fight measures do not only reach little but overload teams and service providers and prepare the patient, pans and their families only worries, need and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last two months we talked to the committee of the Assists, and with the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hope that continuing positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, training analysts, mutual recognition of the curriculum, education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the observance of agreements with BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness leaves elections in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report because of corruption out of office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread election deception in Muslim communities is unknowingly ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of abuse due to" intolerances regarding ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and communal government, who is now an Antkorruptionking, said that the intimidation of voters from religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should lead a passport, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently a voter has to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable inks to a person's finger, if they vote their voting vote to prevent someone to vote twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to church documents and decisions of not official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this not only serves against electoral fraud, but should also protect the government from the wider corrupted and financial fraud that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special tribunal decided that the acting mayor Luton Rahman should abstain after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to" "have guided his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 votes were either dubious, or the result of a imitation in which one person is chosen as someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself particularly alarming to the fraudulent letter of letters - with the older members of the Muslim community pressure made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding expressions to prove identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "as proof has been applied that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there were concerns that... state institutions have ignorantly ignored such behaviour because of" "politically correct" "hypersensitivity concerning the ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activist post letter papers to stop" "reaping". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The report taken into consideration by Theresa May also demands tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immunisation and social fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider choices to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removeable ink on a person's finger, as soon as she has given up her voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Perform systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation to applications on an automatic letter.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists deal with full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give the police the power to set up barriers for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of legislation which facilitates an accusation due to intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (National Council Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography offered in electoral centres.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the constituency stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees generally assert that voters alone enter the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was placed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court rejected Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupted and illegal practices as unfit," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on a number of grounds - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "checkup control" of the election reviews of the Town-Houses.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets of the last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and hidden spreading of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright scraps his tongue at the most dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and stranglehold of a serious test - by removing some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dropped off his course on a euro notes, a railing button on the Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaving every object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and to us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of detaching the flushing button of a traction toilet, already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as their own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he tasted, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by going through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task turned his immune system definitely under a test"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms, and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminescence of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the number of luminometres of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its luminescence was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the bacterial count in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "that comes close to the worst thing I have geroiled in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm not going to lick here anything, because it is disgusting here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We waged crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had sparked some of the things I had told him, just like the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to blame them and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>

<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found ownership in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were grasping holes, wooden planks were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was decorated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she is worried that the apartment is no longer to be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwalls."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseballets, intimidation, drug trafficking, drug trafficking, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, strikers and curses."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skelbet, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>

<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogiated her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">Deloding were cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't care for anybody. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, tomorrow we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally away, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have neglected the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house to which the police were called in regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the lessee failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as delogization is always the last step considering Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will donate comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloding on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">"workers of house management will now have to dream of rubbish mountains, which surround the house"</seg>

<seg id="35">Skelon obtained a fine of money after being guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial confidence.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many rooms of the house were graffiti adorned with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will manoeuvre renter who do not adhere to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">The police of Devon and Cornwall told Angela Crow that deloding was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="2">"those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany is forecasting ten thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it might even become" "some hundred thousand", "the president's president Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard prehension of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had passed Kurdish strongholds earlier months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing from Turkey on the run."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the putsch, there would still be secular and oppositional ethnic Turks."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Chief of the Association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus Erdogan wants to increase the balance on the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chief of the Federation demanded that the federal government positions itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany, too, a" witch hunt "against Erdogan critics is taking place."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The fire mark as a Gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and saws," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper referred to figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Turks already placed the largest group of asylum seekers recognised in Germany before the coup."</seg>
<seg id="22">"on the date of 30 June, this would have been 11.386 people and 29 percent of all of them as asylum-holders (39.625)."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the country election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because more stupid than so far, it is not: summer holidays, heat and land warfare - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers, who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen, or Hiddensee, are not locals, so you are not allowed to choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"these are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate flyers, distribute flyers and count voices at the end of the vote are laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"by September 4, 2016, the election and the last holiday-day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass a campaign against itself just close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one can see from its large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, as it did already his legendary word-bearer Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise Seelions got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Chancellor Merkel the fault of the blossoming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We create" "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if at the wrong time it is in the right place election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major discoveries; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis lies in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target audience did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a pity not to anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely eliminates the usual election conditions at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and air balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this means coking, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has noted that, in the country, you have to pass on the basis that it has to be very strict, to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the provinces of the country hardly there."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU election combatant coking on his fellow combatants is also self-exposing:" "you have to go where it hurts, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because a lot is on the game, Sellering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">S & D Group's news on the European Parliament's Plenary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the election of 2011, the SPD was still clearly won by 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, will make the leap into the land day."</seg>
<seg id="32">"they make a modern virtue out of vacation need, and spend their campaign largely on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the chairman Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"apart from that, green elective fighters go on track searching for native vocal chores among the vacationers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curvt with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Restoration: restaurants suffer from blockage</seg>
<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for construction work, starting at 5.30am in the morning and ending only at 8pm, there are always praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything quite jagged," "tells Elvira Tetzlaff about the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the month, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the contrary will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift driving."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was immigrated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterverband was abolished, and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation in the place has been relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterverband from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomfort," says the Deputy Head Director, responsible for the traffic engineering management of the restructuring unit Florian King. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bachar Road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were seeking and more familiar to their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that many trucks in residential areas have fringed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not met, the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excesses," says King, who made himself aware of the situation. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest speed was at 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become more quiet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look at the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales collapses, everyone is asked to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some more and some are less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the" end customer, "so for other companies, the renovation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the dealership of Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" most moderate decline, "but also admits that naturally" the running documentation is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily loaded are the local along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have made it hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales revenue was "far above 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">"street recognition has dropped off its operation" "by two years." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt addressed a request from Göhner, if it could give a financial compensation, with the indication answered, the restaurant profit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now, it also has to bear the disadvantages that result from the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other counties where a little more generously handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"for all the complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now look less often due to complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it is also somewhere else nice."</seg>
<seg id="42">"that his lineage arrives back after the renovation works, Göhner has no doubt."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, this is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="1">Constantly in the name of counter-terrorism law is screwed to laws.</seg>
<seg id="2">"following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thickened security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a Dulant status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the connoisseur.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not demand anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"also, I took part in this."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as Minister of the Interior, he was in the midst of results and a" "recoverable consensus" "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has failed to submit a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But this is all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot is already known, announced, announced: that a new security authority is to take care of the uncoded communication, is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities does not come as a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière will start a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," said the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he nevertheless believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything, which in the coalition partner anyway has no chances."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he is planning quickset for deportations and more possibilities for the incarceration of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">"refugees, which are targeted in the country, should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for security checks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the event of allegations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unbalanced and are open to questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated - for example - raises the question: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in view of the high refugee numbers, many people worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things, which the people employed deeply, could not cling to the election times either."</seg>
<seg id="30">Inner security has moved enormously.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are elections."</seg>
<seg id="35">The EU and the SPD are therefore increasingly standing in position on the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, it went up between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a secret dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then via a security policy collection of some Unions Interior ministers, in which the resort chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also working for conciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a reversal of the double-pass, he doesn't hold anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have forged the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To replenish you is not reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and with a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns."</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is indeed "reasonable" for the coalition partner must be shown.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of potential for conflict.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the subject of inner security.</seg>
<seg id="46">"the SPD is ready to talk about everything, which helps to increase security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely males average age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section to oversee it under the pseudonym Non-Amnesty Men's Notification, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiple resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely causal group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by collecting hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit, before I stop, hold my hands and dictate something like:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly ironed in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three males middle age) to Reckless Records (Number of units: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20th), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and sold items that he sold when he was young and plunged."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to YouGov's profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people have usually drained their collection around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores have a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of trusted records, from objects that invoke happy adjustments."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector so and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "blurred an employee from a stack of records."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I am blending through a pile of bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of Keys: three Men of middle age) has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead soundtrack so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-oriented, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who only slowly get back."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has an entertaining audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle age women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizers and sexter pop in place of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such a diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely but naothing psychic traumas are hard to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She is making a shopping window rather than buying a shopping bag.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of records is..." she drives away with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I admit that jeans's hot pants feature patterns, I watch a group of young teenagers who are grouping Polaroid cameras for a moment, before a father and his daughter think about buying a crossover record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "Plattenkunst."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research has yielded that the results of YouGov agree, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record-loving women exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumble through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they steer the starring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, who above the shoulders obliges oblivious men of middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which persons within the camp sell goods, sell cigarettes to Energybeverages, sell barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which hold a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is charitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" closure "would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest is eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two help organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals in the course of summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of fijis, when they were hit by a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-stuepping, indent, line-up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by not too bad silver medals - Britain's fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the obvious defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon."</seg>

<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell to and Co., as if you were running in driving busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau fought in the corner."</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while the GB still seeded."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotionless gold than with those games and that wants what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first strokes to the last, 220 hard hieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was all present when they recruited to the second Olympiagold in the second without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who laid on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.4 untrained use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not reflected in the manner of triumphal arch."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no-one lifting the difference and there was no longer able to know whether he would survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>

<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>

<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a nerve-growing morning with her to talk more than usual and tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it repeats only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked."</seg>

<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the drinking water-purpose association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, supports about 150000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="12">There are water delivery contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>

<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budgetary planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"as an outstanding event, she called the commissioning and initiation of the new well (1994), land purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, rebuilding up a central computer control (2004), and the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the reconditioning of water pipes."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there have been no standstill, and I have always resumed new innovations because water is polluted and drinking water is the most important food."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years."</seg>
<seg id="18">"he has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association, and he lived in real life as a water-purpose association as if it were his own undertaking."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district."</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the green electricity subsidy are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the release of the Renewable Energy Sources for the so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday Edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers, the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to the cashier."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a draft agreement with the European Commission following discussions with the Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even these are not exalted in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" Steel is Future, "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry has suffered under overcapacity and a considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to intensify when the world's largest producer of producers made massive steel on the global market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers launch price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>

<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thyssenkrupp's German industry primus remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"lastly, prices would have rather stagnated."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to close also the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, some 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her entire life: she was a young girl in the school choir, she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she is doing something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to vocalize and organize, to be able to rely on the others, and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"who regularly demands his lungs, does not get out of the powder in everyday life too quickly."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generation, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to the everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through song texts and especially melodies, people with dementia suffer from long receding events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires a special achievement, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrating on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just elderly people who live alone, do not just focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition, which one experiences through singing in the choir, means Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I do a long time for something, I will better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there's enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he means to have little talent, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who is listening when a tone goes next?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can easily join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"whoever wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have studied in Hanover which effect the reputation of cat babies on adult animals has.</seg>
<seg id="3">"to their surprise, the males also did not leave the males cold - however they behaved in contrast to the females always the same."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the arousal degree of cat babies in the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">"at 10 percent faster, they respond more quickly to sounds of kittens, which are in great need, as scientists have found out of the veterinary university and the Medical School Hannover (MHH)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"males react also to the calls of kittens, however always the same."</seg>
<seg id="7">"apparently the acoustic differences between the mistrust of less and strongly aroused young animals are either not perceptible or not of importance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH. "</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already figured out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differs with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a call from small children who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger-aroused kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had no offspring, reacted differentiated on the screams," Konerding said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"they turned out faster to the loudspeaker, when this calls to the very excited kittens."</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be congenital or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have responded at all," said the biologist. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noises several times in humans."</seg>
<seg id="19">"some studies also showed that women react more sensitive to infants regardless of whether they were pregnant or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same signature," said Military General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but it is likely to deal with the acts of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the attacks, Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is just local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, one assumes that bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have kept secret evidence of impending attacks in the south of the country, although they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">Still be unclear what group behind the attacks stedge.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution issued by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to hinder chaos while the country pursues stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, withdrew himself to have led the Kingdom to stability and order again."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>

<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, potential contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the party - in this case, the AfD - changes its target direction and becomes extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have stated in recent years that there can be legal-terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that other legal-terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee sheikhs or attacks from other far-right motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">But a nationwide or Europe-wide control of legality is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"they voiced concern about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people, who previously did not appear in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects of attack on asylum shelters were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, perhaps politically indifferent, or have chosen CDU, SPD or left, which, however, have radicalised itself by far-right wing extremists."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always determine the Olympic Games or World Records the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight float from Ethiopia is so slow that it was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks Habte became a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a return of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in subrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, Habte wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media portrayed him as "robel of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" "prosperity belly", "the English tabloid" "The Sun" "with" "Dad Bod" "made him funny."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle, played no part."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the buzzer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to start alone in a pre-run over 100 metres of Freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased once more, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after an excessive calculation, the sewage charges in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that, when approving the budget by the Kulmbach Landratssaal, Kulmbach realised that undercoverings have been used for these wastewater facilities."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal grounds, Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-covering manner."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from the town of Welthahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to step deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt pointed to the panel, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">The period from October 2016 to September 2020 can also be compensated for over- and undercovers from the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in addition, Schmidt founded the engraving fee increases in all three wastewater plants by relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater treatment, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the sewage volumes in all three plants are slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenditures in all three plants, the period of recovery and repair expenditures in all three systems declined significantly."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the complex in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for the thighs, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf sewage plant had to be replaced due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be repaired, the sewage sludge had to be removed, the sewage sludge disposes of the sewage sludge and an additional ventilation option can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "these extraordinary expenses came to the continued care and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which are still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully integrated in the three plants.</seg>
<seg id="20">"as a result, Schmidt added that the market community had spared large entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned systems will continue to remain precarious after the view of stone houses in the long run as one cannot expand the supply area of the Friesenbach Valley sewage plant for these facilities because it is deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat states that this filter is inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are indebted, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million more selfies each day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have taken criticism in the past where they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoting or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when it struck a filter this week, which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and darker cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" Yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have turned off the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of vulnerable cliches."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decided to reject the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"grace Sparapani wrote in an e-mail, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter was" "vulnerable" "and was unpleasantly said."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contrasting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face was pulled into the scorching extremity."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolperdragon.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are different in terms of race than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchat's filters generates an image that is insulting for a user," "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than before," "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racrelated controversies reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the partly white, only male leadership, and terminated its essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat largely unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">"the company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce, and points to its status as a private company."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently set up a personnel responsible focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committees and the defense budget committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command Secret Service analysts, who reported how superiors changed their appreciation to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically fucked by high-level Centcom commanders, reported on a regular basis a positive image of American efforts against terrorism, as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were generally positive as analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "noted Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The leaders in CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed uncertainties in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced the pressure of their predecessors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command's press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" presented. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congressmen from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Republicans called the Task Force to live after them, that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom are underway by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments for ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "the highest-ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "Damaged the morals among analysts and" gave little room for divergent opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. Ship and Democrats gave up, not having found evidence of an intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts as regards a" "definite political opinion". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, which were received after complaints by CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports, while the investigation of the general inspector was still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of last year rejected the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State was reminiscent of disdivisions of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush previewed only a small crew of troops in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker confirms that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, these temporary refineries would have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutchman slightly longer from the path that leads to the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"whatever the game is going on on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years of hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), at 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team, began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work floor in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to completely rip off the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a flashback from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and luped the ball to the goal to give the American female a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"surrounded by the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistently and inescapable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristwatch to the triathlete to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting queue in the coffeeshop without hearing about Simone Scheres, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is involved for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's black with dimples, would certainly have been under these famous names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsoring and well-being TV commercials, if it were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, some in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I don't have enough arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparingly noticed for the last 16 years that many people I had asked, didn't know that it is an olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to a competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 had a athletes who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on a trampoline has a certain exterior charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the carcinogenic tremor of his never-ending wake-up - but also the grazie of exercising and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means much like" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, real and salts) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"you will be judged according to the official Olympic program after execution, level of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medallions must go further, faster, up and down, sometimes down to the finish, sometimes down and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they chase not only the finish line or the output wall, but in television transmission also another ridiculous goal: the world or the Olympiareket."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel myself looking at when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the spruce and objectification of male athletes, according to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley waits for air ringende, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators call for political changes in Ethiopia to attack the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters killed during the clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months protests against the government shook the country, and in more and more areas fared out."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was cruel."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that police officers shot and killed on threescore unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security professionals strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Committee is calling for a more detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely together with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"although Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options besides protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use up to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-criticised vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Orochi Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of becoming flattering beneath the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, because cheap smart phones were becoming more and more frequent and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate over Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versified to detect early signs of discontent and use special officers to manipulate enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unsighted reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of protests protested, which, according to the figures of analysts, were seemingly fucked by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last few months and this time of disturbances went over relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal disparities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters attacked Gondar, an amharan city, run by Tigray, and hatred towards the mitigates becomes more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently hastened that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin ice walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama that ISIS was founded "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump on Friday attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeatedly repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have meant the" founder "of the terrorist group of Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication abilities of the Republican presidential candidate if he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades, who endeavor to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election rally on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump honed in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted on suggesting that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism boasted down Mr. Trump, while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling polls on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he withdrew a strong criticism when he said the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course I mean sarcastically." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "clarify" "depending on how the reaction drops." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, which monitors the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted a more etched tone, as his survey values continued to decline."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologise for his provocative remarks, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while focusing on the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought out his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provoking his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercessors, tried to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's correctness, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbanks, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister, allowed ISIS to spread itself by preventing the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and presented them on each of his words and being preoccupied against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who tried to understand him and said," They can't! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats laughed at Mr. Trumps's apologies as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach as lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat-buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cook for male felines and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways with which the country moved with it to no longer be the country of the country."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense theme," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and Kasserole were staple food, the casserole as a" wonderful way of reproducing food leftovers, "as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hay usually only comes to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland hay only grows with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Grönlandhai swims down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a bullet for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "anyway of a Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifetime, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist presumed that Greenland hay will be stoned."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland hay is hard to observe, finally they mainly live in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hay.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her time pupils measure her, when she equips six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver that torpedoes from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeter measure."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens occurs already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s when atomic weapons attempt to trigger larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lens on the other hand contains a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could classify an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland-sharks obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was plugged into a 120-year old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympics medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London rail World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Anfahre Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time when they appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny, who were victorious four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner competed in the qualification rounds an Olympic chord, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first lap."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap, Hinder was barely back, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which it went into a higher gear to slow it down, and to allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It's a flattering comparison. ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic chord and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side Kenny and Hoys pointed out that after a weak start he fell away on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such a superior victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"one said," "It feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune such as London." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team for the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 Titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the case of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next to the Sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," I enjoy this just for the moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"and he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">"they arrived in 3: 51,942 at the end."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be in focus."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought yesterday with officers before the qualification, when they called him officials to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team will rely on his strong railway team to dominate the mid-season of the Olympic Games and get a Schar of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama was played in the background, such as the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April, in the midst of Sexis.com and Mobbinges and the retirement of magnitudes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like that the now legendary Call GBs, who has reached its climax at the perfect moment, will again be repeated."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces by workers - are at stake, as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract so that all supply contracts will be lifted as the supplying energy company hurried."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the decision of the Victoria government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workplaces - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting pot consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa finished the point Henry Melting, which led to a closure of Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risk a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant, originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar, and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium mold with its Loy Yang A powerplant in Latrobe Valley, told that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp. hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt", "the company shared."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continues to say that the contracts are so-called" "hedging operations" "that should come into effect from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">Contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," said the current supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenues to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL told that the value of the contracts had already written down in the amount of $187 million in the "expectation of a dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to run the melt or to ensure power supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the U.S. company said that 2010 concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have come into effect from November this year even if it is still a declaration of explanation why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland Melting Factory in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts" statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity per year. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set, that would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and went to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians like?), scanned reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz oncels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), ending with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the clichéd act of almost every birthday sepia of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," You thought we had forgotten you? "" with the honesty of a cartoon on a station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"with a view to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of cardashians has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, what the vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that is rather similar to a visual book than a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of the Wälter 615 pages)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of its cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still seeping through the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, the model "as" models, the celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenny's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV history, Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid named them" "Miststück des Augenblicks." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings coded again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to go around on the Missmut seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy CRAWFORDS daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="2">"e-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, Nokia Communicator came to the market."</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clunky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would be today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a couple of euros, fans can still buy the devices on the internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as" "Büro in Westentaschenformate." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator could be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via an HTML browser if also tormented slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was €392 in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No-one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story even though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mobile phone-division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market mastered suppliers that all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, that is today for very many people everyday."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were almost two billion smart phone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"about 1.4 billion units sold have been sold, on Samsung and Apple alone 555 million units alone."</seg>
<seg id="28">Global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>

<seg id="30">"in the meantime, an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, then Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced the introduction of iPhones on Mac-World."</seg>
<seg id="32">"he promised three devices in one: one music player, a phone and an internet communication, easy to use by touch screen."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Apple's triumphant success began, and today the iPhone is the group's most important product."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the look."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we ran a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too large."</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was told that England will never be ready for the games, and that we'll be blinking on the world stage."</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong also at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for a single infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion to a sweaty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the whole of the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which implemented a £11 bn investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we will direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to bypass ad blockage, a" cat and mouse play "is the same for companies that earn money with online advertising."</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block publicity in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktopside would change the encoding regarding its advertising advertisements to make it difficult to detect indicators on which part of the page advertising is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blogger, Adblock Ben Williams spokesman wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the anzeicizing Open Source Community and the converters has been underway since the invention of display blowers "and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blowers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use indicator loopers; almost four times as much as 2013."</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday drowned by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" in an act of despair "on the streets and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss did not want to kill himself at the age of 49 years, which was overpowered by several vehicles, including a truck."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police told them and each of the witnesses of the incident to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative process was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision preventable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor must decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases, where a person was running in the dark on the motorway, it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent murder after having crossed a man and killed a night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street, took the court."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the court stated that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency -- on a justified way, and that the presence of a man on the road was a" totally unusual and unforeseeable situation, "the judge said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited once."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have revealed similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow reversal of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erd-like atmosphere and still slowly revolved."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exponentiates its dayside of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was presumed by Planetary Researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years - exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burnt away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their Hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect, Venus, as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide grouting hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting businesses - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to take advantage of the solutions demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the contested systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to redeeming ransom is much higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacking was scary in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once activated on a victim's computer, it searches for unmodified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the end-key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users are the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">Many hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of sick acts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, it only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers from F-Secure examined the user areas and the contact with the users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually attempting to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or encrypt for free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will private people redeem for payments of a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to retrieve their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"considering the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus supplier Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself, providing advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "says Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses are then looking for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal, and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected host.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then use spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now well-known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a mini van."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, it does not work tightly at any point."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior space are well finished and work comfortably, only the cockpit-top is falling down there."</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a trunk of 453 l with upturned back rests available, but the" Magic Seats "are available."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a swing chair and thus offer storage space, which is from the floor to the ceiling 1.24 m high."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, however the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he should do a little quieter to his work."</seg>
<seg id="13">The average daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>

<seg id="18">"in the top variant" Executive, "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the safety systems belong to the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane support assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warner sometimes irritates because of the maneuvering many obstacles as" "approaching objects". ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign detection and throttle the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, smartphone integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">"who does not want to invest so much, will receive the gasoline from 20000 Euro, diesel starting at 23000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening you wander around eternally, at night you can awake for hours, in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep long before the wake-up ring."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Schlafforgery and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an one- and sleepy disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just the falling asleep feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medication."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is frequent above all for depression," "says Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wakes up every two or three hours, and perhaps starts to salute about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised by the day, should go to the doctor, advises weeß."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment may look quite different: one is downcast, tired, tired, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any sleep mediator in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should contact the family doctor first, advises weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the sleep labor physician, for example, in snoring with respiratory sufferers, in case of illness fatigue, in case of insomnia, or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a midday fight," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, you go to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can affected people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws to make for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"weeping counts on: regular sleeping and stand-up times, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleep, stop drinking alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately and that's not conducive to it."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few linden trees, meanwhile a rest of the cobblestones: the Rīga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem so at first sight, but the police count them to the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>

<seg id="3">"on the facade of a grey house, someone has" ugly! "sprayed."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in contrast to a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon, it is already built: by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new flats."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in recent weeks, however, with burning automobiles."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants rented lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Insenator Henkel has expressed itself several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area called" no-go zone "for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June, on the ground floor, the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, reportedly patrolling official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers pulled out under the cheering of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raised three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the building projects, they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wished for majority police protection from the vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin Insenator and the Police make up between house owners and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them nearly the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rīga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was carried out under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rīga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and choice makers from all over the world: with them residents from GDR times and former home owners share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on taped discs or newly painted facades that were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the criminal offences are making breakthroughs, which tend to hit the newly built and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars can no longer be there in Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously dragged into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former buildings that crowd the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are actually condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well-duped," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for additions that annoy themselves about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez."</seg>

<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Office of Agriculture to Commune and Job Centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work so far, whether you rely on private apartments, such as Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, charitable apartments must be validated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed pests, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be chamfered or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help house masterpieces, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so we need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here management and honorary officers jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it takes time and can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who sometime develop the feeling he could not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems also, says customer honestly," "people with whom nothing goes." "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two of the recent incidents fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says clearly, "what some people may call naive." a residual risk could and may not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," Regine says. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politicians are afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
