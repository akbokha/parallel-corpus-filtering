Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also intended to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal with the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to Israel &apos;s imp@@ ending choice in Israel . &quot;
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girl@@ friend
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note cut on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi , had already signed 300 miles to the school premises , where he has shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ sh@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cle him .
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problem behavi@@ ours .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb praised , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if anything was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail , when he returned to Mississi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 pot@@ ter gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people living there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught ge@@ ography and peda@@ gog@@ y . &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of peda@@ gog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
he was the black woman at that time .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for different companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had ended Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September after Lamb finished his guitar and m@@ outh@@ piece finish before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the municipality on a candle light memorial service . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the University of B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star and Ama@@ zing Grace sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us say that it will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year but the toy and baby products retailer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work for more hours .
&quot; the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 workers were employed in the 2014 Christmas season . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , Christmas business is getting closer and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , ship and distribute products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated c@@ ig@@ ning and an arm length of it to be with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; un@@ str@@ it@@ ingly the biggest time travel movie ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ em@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot;
ban calls on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 In@@ quiry values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks during poll@@ s , it has ( still ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time , Rick P@@ err@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of which also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside counter@@ parties like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey at Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 per cent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
only two out of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he was the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would &quot; &quot; thr@@ ill &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first electoral state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his tem@@ per does not p@@ asse to the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get ac@@ custom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they expose their scholars , Republi@@ can voters consider Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who most likely wins GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four out of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush by the end of July .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick P@@ erry would win the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign can be seen as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while anti @-@ g@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has harv@@ ested majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says they have formed their minds .
a new pol@@ l by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to move to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon , Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump said in his election campaign two months ago from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; the immigration of turning and fishing was in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic pron@@ unci@@ ations of Tr@@ ump decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can Party and the re@@ orientation efforts are dam@@ aging .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in case of immigration matters .
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it apparently will do Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile disappeared around half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also mad at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ lish . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the &quot; &quot; Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg &quot; &quot; you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential varieties , however , one of the award comes to a price like Pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a list of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well marked . &quot;
&quot; well , who can afford it ... &quot;
&quot; by the way : Munich is , exceptionally , not at the top . &quot;
Champions League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it went .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 52 . / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ e hits ( 81 . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; in his 28 hit match in the Champions League , Müller received the char@@ itable Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who let a shot of the world champion crossed as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm scored in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speeches . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed presentation without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the Royal class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , he also stum@@ bled at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went to work courage@@ ously , but with their offensive efforts , however , they often lead to works . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k collap@@ sed from the right half @-@ field in the upper left upper corner .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one was Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer , Brown beat the poles of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct delivery , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians embar@@ ked on their usual game , Pir@@ äus was able to set con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; so , for example , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 51 . ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola dismis@@ sed a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , said Sport@@ leader Matthias Sam@@ mer on &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something else from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an to the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another one . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partially destroyed Bav@@ arians in their audience blo@@ c apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host pir@@ ates with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with impacts against the Munich fans . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : in case of wai@@ ver the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this eman@@ ates from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several collabor@@ ators of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to exceed 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed over 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes for tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore going back to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk , but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing reg@@ ains again to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; declared Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; declared Head of H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to the age of old according to our findings .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking should increase the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arche@@ ologists encounter remn@@ ants of the late anti@@ quity in Cologne on the Rhine
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard arche@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction works on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always adverti@@ sed as a department of archae@@ ology for soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third part of the Rhine Boulevard , the archae@@ ologists were now found five . &quot;
&quot; from text documents had already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with about 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman died at the train station in the Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the people for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by recording the train , she has carried out severe injuries according to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by rescue staff .
&quot; over the reason of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman , the experienced officers are not aware of the findings . &quot;
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner railway , Zi@@ egel@@ er cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute on T@@ TIP
&quot; to mi@@ tig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement , T@@ TIP , the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens dare , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ de introduced the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; until now , the proceedings involved agreed among themselves to arbit@@ rators , a possibility against their verdi@@ cts did not occur . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens un@@ familiar to the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long run , she wants to work on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; for example , there may also be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded especially by large corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against T@@ TIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , through which companies can negotiate damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , bul@@ b national laws or to en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals by the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German Trade Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward . &quot;
&quot; the Commission considered crucial points in the reform , which the Federal Minister of Economics of Sig@@ mar Gabriel has drawn up in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the cost of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when talks on the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , on Wednesday remains uncle@@ ar . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy , acting Fol@@ ks@@ än@@ ger recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places , which he repeatedly shows on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they were born and how it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative Irish .
&quot; with 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; sound composed songs , which harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great op@@ ul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a moving series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be said in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and positively reflects certain expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Ec@@ oise &quot; ) , 2005 a nationwide masterpiece . &quot;
surprising ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; after a very productive experiment , St@@ ev@@ ens then reli@@ ed on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic articles . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long ago the smaller clubs were boar@@ ded , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ ko . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .

&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests now sit in their chairs , the clearly traveled St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without direc@@ ting a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one h@@ ears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only for an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens thanks moder@@ ately , plays acoustic only few older songs and finally bows down under tos@@ sing appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ stu@@ stu@@ d
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ stu@@ ction with sus@@ pen@@ se is expected . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is to announce his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ stu@@ d and for the first time set up with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre @-@ set questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p a few sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony commemor@@ ating the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several front pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ person said he had &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour &quot; and , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements , to the position of the European Union and the limit in winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour had made changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s frag@@ ility is too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from comb@@ ating violence and stri@@ kers , instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle the shadow economic ministers will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also expressed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to withdraw from politics in the style of a &quot; cas@@ per@@ le theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s frag@@ ility . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it first was broadcast on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ stu@@ ction with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds rise due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound rose sharp@@ ly to dates , which indicate a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal goal SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and most profitable estim@@ ation since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v had been received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry stocks were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % .
&quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations , and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again growth . &quot;
&quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars by selling stock as part of his strategy of debt reduction . &quot;
&quot; the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his assessment for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot; &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate for the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could make the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber Expedition in Berlin
&quot; Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; bot@@ her@@ ing 21 years young , a hanging with top ti@@ cker rise . &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavily .
rather even more .
currently Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 is turning .
how Wik@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates at the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the bending construction : here , her i@@ dol is living here , whose poster is attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as her mother E@@ wa earned in half a year . &quot;
if ever .
that says : &quot; actually my Wik@@ toria would have to sit in the 10th grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory school@@ ing ?
who it@@ ches it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even bending does not .
he has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertising in the advertising ep@@ rint of the super @-@ bowls he cas@@ c@@ ashed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple firm flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the bending account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like he and over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you will be amazed at the wind@@ screen . &quot;
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber was finally in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
&quot; it goes both - in the potato field , which the Oldenburg I@@ mb@@ iss@@ eder Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida rally with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; that is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile submitted itself to the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; there , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
the culinary international understanding also comes along well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches ground clearance campaign to tackle al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and grow the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA store shops and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that after the opening of his first markets Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million turnover per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on a high fixed cost basis , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash will lose market shares in eastern states , mainly of Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will drop revenue in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.7 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , said that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to react openly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2012 , i@@ Gas market share has decreased by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailer , has been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction of the debt reduction in sales and margins at the same time . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to equi@@ p sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and deliver I@@ GA retailer to improve their stores with fast growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refur@@ bish@@ ment programs will be put into ver@@ ve and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 , for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ us and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the li@@ mel@@ ight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a sp@@ as@@ f failed to defeat a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was ste@@ ad@@ fast by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite proud about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted a little into the battle , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a ra@@ cket in the U.S. Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ o &apos;s important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed element into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around , &quot; He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time out of the r@@ amp , in which he can only think about it , I consider him appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and arrested all who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indign@@ ation . &quot;
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicop@@ ter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults against the Hungarian legisl@@ ature . &quot;
some reported from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block in a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency uprising in two southern regions on Tuesday gave more powers to overcome the crisis , so that they could shut down streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along his border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia resulted in a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for den@@ ounced traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared its emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters of Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
they come across by dam@@ aging the fence ; they are now in police custo@@ dy and are accused of har@@ assing crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos circul@@ ated the major border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to manipul@@ ate the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to go there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded , but thousands still remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; former US foreign minister H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet declared whether he candidate for the Pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ election elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a great leap forward in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support among the men has decreased considerably , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
but Clinton has a big advantage with older voters .
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election national elections say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially thr@@ illed by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate is also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for election , whoever would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the head . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders is raised from 20 points in race competition to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has asc@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters will be un@@ acceptable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some key features of voters in the election of their party . &quot;
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong executive qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , bi@@ ds are best cut off with hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the pre @-@ election generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain in the office as foreign minister , most Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not been influenced overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general views , although 36 percent said that their opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of the eligible candidates do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote nation@@ ally also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes on leadership . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush sli@@ ce best with hon@@ esty from the six candidates tested . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; in the meantime , the two candidates have lost half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters still support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also yiel@@ ded that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and cl@@ ump Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are with 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in poll@@ s - he ends with 19 % support among the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also revealed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ eves for former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday , during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only af@@ ar off , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holiday@@ makers to find hot water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go into the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continues to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder appe@@ als were submitted to five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft release Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police informed . &quot;
&quot; officials said he was charged with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to approach a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number after Den@@ g got impot@@ ent , and was supposed to wait for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide items and basically put the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ sh@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with st@@ ump@@ y power . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the ch@@ ic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe made an indictment for murder third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with mal@@ icious attacks and the formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; interest income is coming , and the bos@@ ses will fall into recession , lending for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the procedure . &quot;
recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have emphasized so v@@ ehem@@ ently that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of interest income . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , head econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might respond :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest @-@ enhancing things can be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets may be honoured 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is happening after inser@@ ting the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the last six months after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return is thus beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but they often promote interest rates .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; remark@@ ably , the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , at 118 interest rates since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few expect this to continue and expect Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; &quot; If it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made all year round on the interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all elev@@ ating cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing weak@@ ening in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ ession@@ als very quickly put in the shadows after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that bonds are faster than when stocks change when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the loan portfolios drop immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer cooperation between longer and shorter bor@@ row@@ ings , leading to a defl@@ ection of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher earnings , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ sti@@ n in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is flat , loan spann@@ ing have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market if the F@@ ed is tigh@@ tening its strategy . &quot;
companies that wind up the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest charges in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity with their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also profit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could be seen through higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broadcast@@ er for his &quot; &quot; de@@ duction &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly unable to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the broadcast@@ er to prove that he does something that the private broadcast@@ ers do not . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; the word - but it seems to change to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
&quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot;
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think it is important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports , came under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot;
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC who was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in the special BBC way .
&quot; he added , he wants the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude ordering from other series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the fee ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ s down in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost@@ s . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG selling index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decl@@ ining sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers came to their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers @-@ websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that 5 £ issues were spent a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the Cran@@ e accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially places the breakdown of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were worn through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , dressed extensively in white , the track to declare their respect , when the first of the dead drew their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ aissance C@@ emetery . &quot;
the fun@@ eral pro@@ cession passed on to the Holy Place where only days before a building crane was over@@ thrown by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then onto the bed@@ side .
&quot; the bodies were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi king handed over the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster , which left also 3@@ 94 injured , a sanc@@ tion hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 persons who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was supported . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ler in the Grand Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that H@@ add@@ an will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today , king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group said , would not have let the arm of the crane stand , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service didn &apos;t report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the overthrow of the Cran@@ e , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the grand @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims stood in front of the H@@ add@@ man who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group did not publish statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was dismis@@ sed by the family in 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials say that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other verses get half of this amount .

&quot; it is alleged that the British put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen , who carry out work in their homes . &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; the British are increasingly employing cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople to carry home jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new president of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tre@@ ehouse chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services to low prices is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores to address arti@@ sans and close 60 outlets of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten buy decisions in the shop are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , who make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
we have to shift this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed on the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies roughly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ ien A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ ek A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and amor@@ tization .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with mis@@ use .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been acqu@@ itted in force in May . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the def@@ end@@ ants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the years 2006 to 2011 that the accused were allowed to disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he damages the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial tre@@ aties .
&quot; this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; for the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted the fact that at no time an asset was created for the association . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries had only reck@@ oned for reimbur@@ sement of expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 60@@ 0.000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were standing before the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told us , in the bread profession of the financial officer . &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance was laid down in the bank as security , &quot; &quot; he said in the conf@@ is@@ cation . &quot;
&quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts to be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses had been approved retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was paid on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , also l@@ ump sum and not detail entries seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; accounts and Sav@@ ings were administered together by the two def@@ end@@ ants , the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for the financial bore , but it was important only to have the freedom of school , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one functional investigation due to abuse of office , an amount of € 120,000 was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , declar@@ ing the def@@ end@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account went on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant , and was not known to the association according to its statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused would have been informed , justified his function@@ ary . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; compensation claim . &quot;
&quot; why damage compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; on top of that , the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he would not agree with this formulation , because the association had never had any harm . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never purchased a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned for mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ ets , he charged 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ end@@ ants could not demonstrate exact documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer maintained after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
kilomet@@ re money was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings were made in cash , and he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his hom@@ etown to the bank , and explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing continues on 23 September with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ alls more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the reduction in personnel reduction for three years , the computer giant will be able to reduce further jobs when it comes to spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the U.S. computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not come to an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 locations in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of USD 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) are to be saved , the company shared on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 HP employed some 300,000 associates . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : breaking of Viol@@ ence at Serbian @-@ Hungarian B@@ order
&quot; on the Serbian border , the Hungarian police have deployed Tr@@ än@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ gur@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundreds of established refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind the police officers a police line had formed and there was a floo@@ d@@ light behind the police officers .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially used pep@@ per@@ al spray .
&quot; after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ gur@@ as . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now retired a little longer .
a pregnant and apparently wounded woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out . &quot;
other refugees packed into themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the police officer of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pep@@ per@@ al spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was still last week of opinion that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation rate . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ ost@@ ly outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to focus on an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death Sag@@ itt@@ arius at the Delta State University ordered In@@ tuition Comp@@ ens@@ ation
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he would &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social sciences education at Delta State University , called emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said he had shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was in the house but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; but will probably be up@@ set . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; at the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he will not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen picked him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 Lamb received a doc@@ torate from Delta State University , as his life @-@ lau lies on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars that have lost their luck charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ ress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against Leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor report@@ edly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
&quot; as a result , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the worldwide approximately 1,000 managers worldwide will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , there are no new negotiations . &quot;
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline distributed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the cheap flights of Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
the board team headed by Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will in future be responsible for Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective bar@@ gaining between the cock@@ pit and the cock@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed again on this Thursday after the dispute . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; Cock@@ pit wants to come to yield results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between Union and Air@@ line has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of the pilots , the background is the concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
it seems that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitors stretches over the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven won the Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside def@@ ender to we@@ eping and exclusion for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w died in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a dual frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then lasts six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account said , &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins right now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg @-@ break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry about it .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label issued in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron writes in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead gives a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of the need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if it were not yet suspic@@ ious : the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of the need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing Street spokes@@ person said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons staff , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
here related news : Adam Ly@@ th eliminated from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer &apos;s results are aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their best choices . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , man had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss blo@@ gged his stance , even if he did not get such good performances and that is not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and reverse .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England was first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer I set up .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square that met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this obviously depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een alongside Cook , which would render an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks , emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a man cannot beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has probably not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ est@@ ers@@ hire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
he made three hundred ranks right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes back in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup . &quot;

Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the predicted . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .

the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit Britain from the EU ) could win at Zul@@ u if the economy falls into a trap by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new negoti@@ ating strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who was severely damaged due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at l@@ ately said some member states , so deeply mired in different crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split allow@@ ances and distur@@ bing amendments that they do not want , are full . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not even if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , looking for a UK outside of the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even plan not inten@@ tionally comment , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , presum@@ ed my friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone as it did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who has made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but determined that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , better ban@@ anas are distributed to dist@@ ra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact Mili@@ band was more bla@@ z@@ oned than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ ons referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the un@@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters who then opened a rear door . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on the back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste any time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch , strategy of 80 &apos;s years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ den@@ cy and the wild cin@@ ematic of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism everyone can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the seventy @-@ two years when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to keep &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C talked to his comrades and members after all reports on their clause on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the media campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite economic economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sident , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ fest is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital , they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called itself . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and indicated the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal of Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expected that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to bring their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director had previously received American Tob@@ ac@@ co funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the financing he should have received after reports previously reported by the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line was attended by p@@ he .
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work is significantly more significant that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of most products in most criteria , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions is discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far , that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were considered a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well Being at p@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes health risks are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people per year die of a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs two billion US £ per year . &quot;
&quot; by presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should abandon East@@ En@@ ders , says ex boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ itters .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for publicly @-@ conducting programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broadcast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee within the scope of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio frequency , which I don &apos;t consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as broad support as possible for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I &apos;ll have to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows will return what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where one can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their duties and they can argue if they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course , everyone thinks that one gets a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for 150 £ , wonder if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , &quot; to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take an example to the public broadcast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , to inform , clarify and maintain . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and deal with the commercial broadcast@@ ers alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they have sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by turning mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to support the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that dischar@@ ges electrical impulses into the brain of people for the treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in general , thread@@ wor@@ ms do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures , called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultrasound to modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of the light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the Ce@@ ase@@ fire - through a Le@@ erst@@ elle of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign to avoid them . &quot;

&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a stri@@ de of the British government and the guarantee that tor@@ turers are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally at our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ table 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term dis@@ comforts of others . &quot;
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the arrival in student residen@@ ces reaches from slightly nerve w@@ re@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sne@@ ak : people tell where you come from where you come from where you come to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to even if your eyel@@ ashes were on fire and these extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract attention and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted from con@@ vi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closed by che@@ eks .
&quot; as you begin the Uni at the climax of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the claw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to handle well @-@ balanced as my ro@@ ommate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people away from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly caused her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would arrive random@@ ly to the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be deep embarrass@@ ing when you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse to ran@@ som them , separate themselves and see them every day and maybe experience how they mig@@ rate to all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart walks its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your subordin@@ ate a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fine than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good mare is funny , but it only takes moments before he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , you never forget anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but do not stap@@ le their poss@@ essions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;

&quot; so , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only mother and the ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build today still cheap and well , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms does not have any sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
&quot; in view of the flood of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
bor@@ row@@ er : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when one puts people in living blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?

&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the towns l@@ acks the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; guil@@ d : there were those , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only mother or the ear@@ ner . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build today still cheap and well .
that &apos;s what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when an Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , tap &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may dis@@ connect half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Chess Club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has recorded another member in its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who held in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that directed Alfred Klein .
&quot; thus it is possible to record chess players , which cannot bring the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the city .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ stadt Anton@@ is@@ ft have joined the social foundation under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new start at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to consulting , one can also attend courses there . &quot;
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the purchasing market , from now on , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seek@@ ers will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of the health care providers . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been providing our out@@ patient care service that often caring relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; not rarely , many services of the insurance companies are not used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ is@@ ft and the citizen hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the retirement center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; described Heike Rie@@ del , CEO of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center can be seen particularly in the demographic change .
&quot; for this , a good de@@ centralized infrastructure is essential in the individual city districts of Bamberg in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular soci@@ able soci@@ alizing . &quot;
&quot; thus , the Social Fund makes a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 a.@@ m . &quot;

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ years passed away
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died already on September 5 at the age of 92 , like the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday hur@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was stated in the broadcast . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freel@@ ance architect , but was also active as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to furnis@@ h the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg in Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

&quot; as a result , meadow stor@@ med from the shop , s@@ worn the officer and cast her the fine fine before the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reported . &quot;

&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
only after that I decided whether meadow is shown or not .

&quot; witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m@@ ons : on Friday evening , at 23 : 45 , three young men were on the road from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried to the young people and hit the face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered from the nose @-@ bone frac@@ ture and bleeding strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim at first . &quot;
the injured young man was now brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove out demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a head@@ stock , one checked on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a vag@@ ue t@@ attoos are available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practice Fel@@ stan@@ ausen and is investing 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stan@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promotion U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice field trip on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel &apos;s retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing on his successor during the next months . &quot;
&quot; after a phase of conversion , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the field appearance before years Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , met , who are currently doing their professional training at the Golden Hospital and who also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the gar@@ bage collector bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Vil@@ sen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , following his medical studies in Hanover in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed head physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is voluntarily engaged in the DR@@ K @-@ prepar@@ edness broken Vil@@ sen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stan@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Internal Medicine ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home doctors . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out of it , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the remo@@ del@@ ing the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asonic examinations as well as long @-@ term and endurance @-@ EK@@ Gs and need a speaker room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50,000 euros will receive the gar@@ bage as part of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ t@@ ese mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come into practice field breaks , in North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in As@@ endorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stan@@ ausen .
&quot; if no successor had found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers Talk hour , by the way , still looks above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rock @-@ fr@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ arewell , an era ends in As@@ endorf . after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; the Ur@@ sel Field House reminis@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a little melanch@@ oly , after the long time , already sen@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients often , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband adds laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter site . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed on gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that anyone wishing to submit a asylum request can &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people is par@@ amount .
&quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; the minister said . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia ref@@ uses &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue travelling to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; quite like this , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , however , is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen Area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slov@@ ene wants to not abri@@ dge his borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; says Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to pass by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the close corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik always met police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it was mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children . &quot;
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in action .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ on with around 4,000 refugees , Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is it that people are wise to suggest specific routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; it was called . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been on the way through Serbia all night long from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary made us , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little far@@ ther west .
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible escape situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners since then have consistently obtained a good certificate regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
on Serbian side there are still 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports they would have spent the past night at the border crossing , Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
Serbian Minister of Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be dealing with very high refugee numbers at this time .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region , there are still no min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatia war . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the Head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteers .
&quot; while man@@ ch attacks spontane@@ ously to chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the sentence &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others are short , read , say sentences such as &quot; &quot; so far I am not &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .

&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective promotion is good for the twenty @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to disclose themselves publicly to the tables , is understandable , and ultimately it is a very personal thing . &quot;

&quot; confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce aid , by calling volunteers , she immediately reported and was there when it was founded in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 honorary men - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job and experience and experience .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , keep it precious and precious the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and super@@ visions of the death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ants .

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ Ear@@ nings Mix@@ ed , Financial Views lowered for 2016 &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the after@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10@@ ,90 € in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than with previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower prospect will come in spite of the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for body@@ flooring of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November onwards . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces solid yields if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in production and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vacation rental were announced one day later than those of the Ri@@ val UPS that plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , predicted by T@@ acks Investment Research analysts predicted . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
analysts asked six of Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex posted a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales to stagn@@ ation in its unit Express shipment . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent in the body transport , but the operating result was basically low due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was reduced due to higher labor costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ cor is spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall there is a wall painting of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented inc@@ est interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on global financial markets could be anx@@ ious to intensi@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the agency Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an interest rate this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that indicates only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value was 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , head econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to raise the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharp@@ ening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the set wait . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level seen as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , head econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world gathered at the end of the month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that the Chinese economy slow@@ ed down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered this month , with what the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the high level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the U.S. staff . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should be technically not included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority of the world has become .
the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere hint of the leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed can &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , &quot; triggered turbul@@ ences around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also discuss with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management at En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; patent , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates for a interest rate , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its lending rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; despite limited noticeable impact on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ ner said . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives had revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a serious crisis such as the re@@ unification of 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she fears a interest rate because the markets are up@@ set , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is altered , I don &apos;t think it should pre@@ dict the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , he is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried products , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car division if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the whole purchase makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the cooking kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the c@@ ash@@ ups and has various tak@@ e@@ away options .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches with her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she is doing it in asylum seek@@ ers at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different from a real school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition is during the breast@@ feeding period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustments that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet generally affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ h@@ room Building at the Bern@@ dorf Sports Centre is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent joint meeting the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions .
&quot; previously , the committee decided , among other things , an application for a construction @-@ legal &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was given permission for a special form relating to roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels : &quot; &quot; this way we get a wonderfully large South @-@ roof together , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; again , it was about the pitch of the roof , which is intended for energy reasons - differently than in the construction plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this reduces the volume of the hall significantly .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the cultivation plan permits no &quot; exceptions &quot; regarding the pitch of the roof - with the Bern@@ ese community usually rather restric@@ tive to liber@@ ating agreements . &quot;
&quot; in the case of gymn@@ as@@ tics , however , it is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ astic construction at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ band funding .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Land Council for Testing . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; these are seeing the surprising plans of the Hospital Group of the county , confirmed by the District Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; but a decision on this , however , the Supervisory Board , and the meeting on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should be reloc@@ ated to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees were informed about the plans .
&quot; the change cancelled by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only a medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who was ready to take the lead and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au on October 1st . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this yields a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on internal station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years fisher@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ haft , which still has 35 beds , is to finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 when the currently ongoing rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; land@@ lady J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chair@@ person of the Supervisory Board , came out against rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ wehr , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this I conclude . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was unable to say there were several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psych@@ iat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; Fis@@ her@@ men on the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as a head physician for more than 30 years , did not give it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the doctor .
&quot; the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was always threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the Bad@@ ener at the B@@ HC took a painful defeat and have something to make up there . &quot;

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspic@@ ious man has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; one since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as a public prosec@@ utor and police officer on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was arrested on Tuesday evening , according to the statement , and the investig@@ ator executed the discovery site of the dead . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after they had come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen not as agreed upon at home .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first bite on personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the event of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , there was eventually a suspic@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the bodies were found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrested was report@@ edly admitted to the police , killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and laid the dead in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead to the burden . &quot;
the investigation of the near@@ er circumstances of the act shall bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warn of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution conflicts on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; alliance . &quot;
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; with this , 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency accommodation . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany pus@@ hes a housing deficit , which gets bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently there are approximately 77@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ained by Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many appe@@ als therefore stayed in large cities in flat @-@ room flat @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed in@@ vari@@ ably longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the le@@ aching on the housing market .
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has declined for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
new incentives are meant to boost the social housing construction again .
&quot; thus , on the basic income tax will be wai@@ ved and the corn@@ erst@@ ones of subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be exposed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is necessary to create attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding program for refugee shel@@ ters of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received by towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , at 184 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia condemn Cor@@ ridor
&quot; there is practically no breakthrough to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without barriers .
but the route is dangerous though .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia by setting up a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the sealing off the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new legislation which came into force on the same day also virtually elimin@@ ates proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia in the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t come across a border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip involves other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , there are hardly more refugees coming to Hungary after the border closure . &quot;
on Tuesday police attacked 3@@ 66 people attacked .
shortly before the gate on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border z@@ a@@ dem as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned sentences thre@@ aten to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum requests were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there would have been 40 refugees there . &quot;
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum granted in Hungary .
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure country country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to clean up .
they collected the gar@@ bage that the tens of thousands of people had left in the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were disman@@ tled and one of the host camps in the border town was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only has a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Fre@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing up when suddenly ten people with travel officers stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to travel to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; previously , we first missed the un@@ hoped @-@ in guests , with j@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
we immediately said we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; that was , of course , for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded tow@@ age passengers moved to a regional train to Pass@@ au in Wels on Sunday evening , in order to try it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border . &quot;
the regional train was demoli@@ shed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing generally is high in class .
&quot; the bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ cris@@ y policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor has brought up highly official and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to find out that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the coming winter to produce decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 Winter@@ proof Quar@@ ters &quot;
&quot; with the underground , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to provide lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without big hu@@ stle , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a requirement of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the same year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide 15,000 of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; Konrad said . &quot;
&quot; with the governor , he has already held talks . &quot;
&quot; they would have secured him , even for the next refugees to create neighbour@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria , it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in an emergency , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ ers have to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the col@@ lo@@ qui@@ um . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the ministry of the Interior , he was more successful in placing him , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic to explain how they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
the search for Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ Search was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; first , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned can currently do without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , additional locations should be tested for their suitability . &quot;
the Chief Financial Officer has critic@@ ised the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; boundaries are not turned off &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has announced further action in the refugee question on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no need for special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the search@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger demanded once again greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial area is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six stor@@ eys of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is stri@@ pped , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine investing in startup companies of the new ship@@ yard and later also acquire which to acquire .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site of S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt arc@@ ades : after all , she now gained new growth in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , now everything about ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I thought for a long time , if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; said Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were driven by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has got time from her mother to cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many woman wearing a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional lady cannot answer with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag of each outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this feature also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , comm@@ its journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office g@@ rie@@ zes the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Palat@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ zeit is a term many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants location is related to it over sixty corners .
&quot; his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ cher Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think people find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed by their stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous young@@ sters , along with Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he didn &apos;t bring it to the King of the Hear@@ ts there .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to say that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump therefore comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company was first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Palat@@ inate belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not accept Tr@@ ump , because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , had declared the Director of the Institute for Palat@@ inate History and Folklore , Roland Paul , at the start of the film . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally prominent statements by descendants .
he had repeatedly appe@@ aled to Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; just like the pol@@ lin@@ ter , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was bor@@ row@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather distant , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pension @-@ host@@ ess Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t give the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wn at the time of his grand@@ father in the United States would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ gi@@ ers , even in the United States awak@@ ens interest . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the Vice @-@ President &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park won the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ ber villages . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain clim@@ ber &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson also ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the Liber@@ als leadership , but there have not been any major shifts in the Today Reviews . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast@@ ed by the Federal Capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week@@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers as Sun@@ rise generated average 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals , compared with today today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase was compared to the Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) ratings and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , in the last months , the gap to Sun@@ rise closed . &quot;
&quot; in August Today we reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September Sun@@ rise is on average 34@@ 9,000 spectators at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father , who decided to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe resulted in an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour a total of 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at , average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident , that hot @-@ seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 . &quot;
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars minute that won &apos;t survive the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood finally ends in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in the greatest secret . &quot;
none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have om@@ itted themselves in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game spoil , who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly called themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noted ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked whom wood should choose , if not her , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be aired on Wednesday , 7 : 30@@ pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open workout day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula reli@@ ed on his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt @-@ return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a P@@ unt who was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing happening now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot;
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ ag@@ ram .

the free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to high refugee numbers .
&quot; party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn clo@@ ister in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a heavy crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1,000 extra teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get inj@@ ections in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free Cho@@ irs met until Friday in the French Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , entirely different main themes were intended . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to deal with the causes , &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one Free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum systems : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the host boss critici@@ zed that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we br@@ anded uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more action @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country policy should not fall under the table in large @-@ scale capital .
a long lasting tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Education Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; in 47 gram@@ mar schools . &quot;
but that is not far enough to Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW MD . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want .
free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
the German stock market has closed on long distances of trend @-@ setting and nervous trading history with profits .
&quot; only in the afternoon , a fixed opening of the US exchanges resulted in a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently recorded around 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
&quot; as a result , many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect markets to come in place until after the interest decision in the US and also for the big event on the dates listed on this Friday . &quot;
the discussion about the loads arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and left its mark on E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax head .
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US An@@ le@@ ger@@ magaz@@ ins &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; at present , investors provided little attention to the German chip manufacturer . &quot;
investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were set off than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the automotive Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent or 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits were increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on the listed German securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.9 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Federation @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro fell to $ 1.@@ 12@@ 62 in the afternoon .
&quot; at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had fixed the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after police officers shoot a rubber gun on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police ra@@ cked gum cas@@ ings into a crowd , who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , deputy regional official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber floors .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , known to them that they can kill , but traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last week of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ ain@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alization of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; a mix of trade , trade and living - concrete offers are not yet planned . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market a land of about 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; it is waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city . &quot;
which investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Ecke Big Street , already a few months ago bought and the buildings are demoli@@ shed . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday res@@ ett@@ lement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their Freizei@@ tzentrum
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , grilled , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday res@@ ett@@ lement lie near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized emblem of &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group accused of investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends addressed the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; violent reactions among marine owners , who had come to the meeting , sh@@ ou@@ ted the pictures and new details on the hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears some other project critic that the traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; entire buses must come so that this pays off &quot; , &quot; said Mr Schulz . &quot;
what exactly happens on the well a hect@@ are of the former inn is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches double donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign aimed at bringing about $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to disclosure of the donation call on its blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark train and bus journeys , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / refuge@@ ec@@ ond to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
report by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diab@@ e@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
&quot; over the years obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in humans who are sick obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital collected data that they have been collecting in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c sl@@ ur@@ ry - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those under@@ going this operation sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease was complete and 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison to this , diabetes was only one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also supervised the patient &apos;s blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ omy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 versus 5.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we are waiting too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is increasingly observ@@ able in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the sho@@ al of her youth after years , and this fall in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the novel is likely to be interesting above all for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the inauguration of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mired , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions as a true peace and true development , mainly through education , can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and revealed that the US &apos;s violent reaction drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and this caused unfor@@ es@@ een consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama said . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age rose from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more frequently associated with these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a test on social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ zer ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for inf@@ ants , very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison center in the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children get there , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sp@@ lashes of sc@@ iss@@ ors of frag@@ rant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered to be drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah ab@@ dic@@ ated her words , and was not able to go when she arrived in emergency . &quot;
&quot; doctors supervised her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities may susp@@ ect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade planned in New York State to po@@ ison their &quot; gem@@ m@@ ical &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products all around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; &quot; s@@ nu@@ ff &quot; &quot; and instruc@@ ted disciplinary measures to the school body . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in a rear @-@ end colli@@ sion between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and on herds , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old motor@@ ist was easily injured in a rear @-@ end colli@@ sion . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the trans@@ verse sp@@ ange towards the round@@ about industrial area and noticed too late that at the round@@ about two pres@@ ump@@ tuous vehicles had stopped .
&quot; as a result , he colli@@ ded with his lor@@ ry to the rear of an audience and sh@@ ove this vehicle to a standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in case of accident @-@ related vehicles , property damages amoun@@ ting to about 10 000 euros was created , the police shares with . &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede about Dis@@ harmon@@ ie
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about dis@@ harmon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was dismis@@ sed spontane@@ ously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control because they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ men - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; said de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will spin things around , s@@ wear Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points ahead , clearly stands at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening . &quot;
we feel this exactly like this - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better .
now standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious on January @-@ Transfers

ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players coming in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there is no team who has won anything , in Po@@ kal@@ os or Li@@ gen , who won &apos;t win games of this kind either . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is rising .

why I shall be witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and because there are often more applications available than seats available , there is a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be selected , will watch it un@@ emotion@@ ally . &quot;
I cannot .
I will sit beside Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; it could have form@@ ulate &quot; better , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public@@ ity work of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a fav@@ ored fact .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters where you can turn to it .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he was persu@@ aded the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police official trying to &quot; &quot; gently exc@@ essi@@ vely &quot; &quot; to return to the shore . &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale police was set up on Tuesday for a break @-@ in incident at Becken@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ins . &quot;
championship soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspiring locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that the st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he pointed to the Stew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ tasting at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go about raised main , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Terr@@ y B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I am doing within my st@@ alls , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should be bound to their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this lead me to think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard behaviour and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and off@@ end me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about them . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations @-@ Levels of the Train@@ ers have established themselves with the long @-@ term cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could throw his license across the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the uns@@ killed Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race day treatment rule described &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse deb@@ its , which was against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it was also so on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the day of racing . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
the police arrested a man after a colli@@ sion with a cycli@@ st and driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ham on the weekend .
the cycli@@ st was accompanied by helicop@@ ter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man made up of Nath@@ alia the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged for driver cur@@ sions and dis@@ advant@@ aged assistance and because of other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring battle
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL . &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co coach Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly conce@@ aled comment to the Storm team after his team finished the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his crew and said that at Tac@@ kling , they were only focused on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the critics of two leading trainers in his team agree with confidence , as it proved that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this always appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring @-@ fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided the trend revers@@ al for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train .
&quot; it is funny , as this shows again and again at this time of the year . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy attacked B@@ enn@@ etts idea of &quot; &quot; exciting soccer &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team in 2010 , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we look at as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to have to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think about us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roo@@ sters game reached a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points a bit more thrilling ?
&quot; for me , it is the game plans . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; beer with 200,000 $ deposit after drug possession &quot;
&quot; a man , possibly threatening a lifel@@ ong punishment due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay who arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants at the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ like penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the agent of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café it could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ables of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
&quot; in case of a colli@@ sion with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in the direction of Basel in front of a permanent construction site .
&quot; the third driver noted it too late , trying in vain to turn to the left in the last moment , as the police hur@@ ried . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker demoli@@ shed completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure p@@ ests to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to claim pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he fell asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping dog .
she saw it by finding the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed her mother immediately .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed then computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for the search for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; p@@ ests on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it was done , because he wanted to pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten p@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and we@@ eping .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have been viol@@ ated on 25 January of this year and did not appear before court hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ender Greg@@ ory S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because one could argue that there was no significant sexual element in his transgres@@ sion . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdi@@ ct until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case , but was held in provisional custo@@ dy due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
bad user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up aside from the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ ds left out for fear of discovery and arrest the people at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the Inn border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the country districts Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and con@@ ges@@ tion .
there they are taken at reception by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8@@ am , a spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border , the city had reached the city on Tuesday of 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : dri@@ pping of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of Stur@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) distributed in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the footh@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , even until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the Lake Constance rice with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun rises again for a longer time . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , above all , there is movement among the compact cars that are currently very well selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations fell out of this segment , according to the Federal Statistical Office ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Public Days 17th to 27th of September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new premium cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ erships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
Opel presents a start @-@ up below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra features a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as five @-@ door versions . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as five @-@ door in a conventional and an accent@@ u@@ ated sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan feeder wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers put a hand on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed floo@@ d@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; above all , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; at the IAA in the compact class , added a series of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , who was staying in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners generally are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the parties may even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to the specification of his lawyer , was once again on a free foot , had been moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his ten@@ ure due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the constitutional judges raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and re@@ mitted the case for re @-@ testing there . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber of Appe@@ als now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons for compensation were only a few days of arrest for compensation , an equ@@ ation was given , it was called . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money for money .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus they said only in April to an in@@ mate compensation , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed on a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was placed between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case for three months .
&quot; in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons of Berlin have been hit the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to bats , because of the ten@@ se situation has already come . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the judicial system , 21 places in te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young men , 19 are to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after proj@@ ections of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to include a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that .
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 350,000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Economics ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing is out of the rental price binding , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually had to be created , and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.4 billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; according to Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation , the refugees in Germany would not have been systematically asked about their qualifications . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they will find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migrant researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political shift according to Thr@@ än@@ ker : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was formerly a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the views have mostly prev@@ ailed that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German language .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that work@@ places are most often given by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is based on the view of Thr@@ än@@ ker of the Königs@@ weg to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration established that only a few parents put their children into the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sto@@ dy , spokes@@ person for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to convince the family about the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ sets in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators is to rise sharp@@ ly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin sen@@ ate would try to increase the capacity of training - for instance by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Student Association estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception to so far Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance . &quot;
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or debt have no benefits after the asylum application performance law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in general , the latter do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the guar@@ dian persons . &quot;
&quot; so far , patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this fi@@ r is reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , say Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely swe@@ ep the same rights as they have the churches and continue to develop the existing state churches rights to a new state religion relationship .
the founding of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association would also be very important to take care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent . &quot;
&quot; although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination law , and an General Equ@@ al Opport@@ unity Act . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention are committed , must become reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing healthcare to the previously expected refugees , &quot; said Dr Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery claims to susp@@ end all deri@@ vatives right from registration health cards . &quot;
services rendered may later be invo@@ iced with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum application law prescri@@ bes . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make especially the language barriers to create . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse over their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over not only in clinics , but also in medical practices . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have already been helped with more general medical conditions in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; under refugee trage@@ dies , there are clearly more un@@ treat@@ able disabilities , and with the young people go about HIV @-@ education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other disease pictures , German doctors came from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite in@@ fest@@ ation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to see . &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , even alle@@ vi@@ ation may be seen by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and yet again submit examinations . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; they are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee crisis is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from among other things , on so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; until now , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can place an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the processing usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide if a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw all age groups into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst moves to the Man@@ ege on the brick and washing up . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; passion &quot; - under this motto , stands the current stage of management . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the family thus lies in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; cocktail cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival of Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to take the Cub@@ an duo loose .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; except for numerous laugh@@ ing sal@@ ons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
balancing on a sco@@ op with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yuan is not a problem .
ser@@ pent @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and is fascinated by her flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the position of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sts &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the arena . &quot;
the upper@@ most order thus : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little jum@@ bo there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at its shows from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal show is open from 10 am to 6 pm every day . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with calls . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them against Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the members of Parliament that the immun@@ ity in parliament is ending , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is concerned about the dangers for politicians .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will plan to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; expected down@@ turn leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP leader and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to make electric installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage one named &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring to manage the rep@@ aying of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused business produces a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his history his participation in the next summer of the European Championship is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 from Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last for the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to take a little break off , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al was clear favorites to pass by group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by the far @-@ away hope to lead the club to his first victory in Europe with his management . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; friendship celebration : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now has become more desper@@ ate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men are proving on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ me@@ ful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , aiming to question the culture which hin@@ ders men from searching for help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental health friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led through social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even though in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and how a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the Schön@@ e at Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on his head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football bells in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it often even if they often hold back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of phone pastoral care I explained to me : &quot; &quot; my role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ assass@@ inated has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; as very my objective out@@ sider status over the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest when you celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria Me@@ ets to help PS@@ G to m@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria arrives on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; in less than four minutes after the start of its Champions League debu@@ ts , di Maria found a PS@@ G player who brought the French champion along the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally reached their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against Swedish masters , as they do not only aim to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and look back at ease , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet scored one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 ounce in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was dischar@@ ged by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who was able to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he interpreted why when he passed down in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , he passed pretty nicely to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , passing by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some false pas@@ sports and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched by no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had put him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shoot shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus obtained his sixth Se@@ as@@ on@@ tor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and out of the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before replacement players E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi discovered a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fier matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; based in Switzerland , mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is affected by the collapse of raw material prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars by selling stock as part of its enormous debt redemption plan . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devast@@ ating effect on markets . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi J@@ in@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and inv@@ ents President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a Sta@@ ats D@@ iner , after the two leaders conducted bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President xis visits will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding China &apos;s alleged cy@@ ber spi@@ on@@ age and increasing self @-@ confidence in controversial waters of the southern Chinese sea . &quot;
440 @-@ hp sports cars bor@@ row@@ ed and driven to scrap
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfil a dream and gave himself a Ford Must@@ ang .
on the wet motorway then came the evil awakening .
&quot; with a company in the district of Got@@ ha , one can fulfil the dream and ride a V8 US sports car Ford Must@@ ang Boss 302 with 440 hp . &quot;
so this was also a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the district of Got@@ ha .
&quot; on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream was then past and past . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got into the sk@@ id on wet way and drove into the console . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered death damage , nobody was injured . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at 40,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented changing from FC Bayern in 2008
world and European Champion X@@ avi has been playing the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern , just a few years ago , was just ahead of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times podium winner , four times champion league winner , twice World Champion , twice World Champion , twice World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he was already before the European Championship in Barcelona before the end of 2008 .
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we did nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; remember : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken under contract Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; with that , he has inspired me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds turned out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King class triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on to Play Di@@ versity in Film Produc@@ tions
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when she emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with s@@ worn dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white hal@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; &quot; in the end , their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide effect and forced legislative powers and authorities to enjo@@ in discrimin@@ atory practices against color . &quot;
in February the singer Prince played an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is uncle@@ ar .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowns first Champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operator assistant Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 foot rope climbing rope was in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge for three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock at the win of the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to the Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , even though he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , he gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ eful@@ ness . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has some gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they exchanged the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for a second season , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once again , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins spent a chance to climb inside one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the 2nd American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to close this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of any game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game . &quot;
&quot; the nomin@@ ee tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ time hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he sw@@ ung the heart@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; said aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the but@@ to@@ cks at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a b@@ unt and Simon made his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier the Stri@@ ke@@ out before replacing it with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man he was faced with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who ra@@ ced a two @-@ run under the right @-@ hand gr@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , Wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sty@@ led s@@ ano out of three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cancelled prior to the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had missing more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , he released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers moved to the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A.@@ P. &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .

&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start fighting the T@@ wins . &quot;

hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who visited it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden wed@@ ded on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several Spor@@ th@@ als of the H@@ ess@@ ische Landes@@ hauptstadt have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the government president responsible for initial admission , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he rejected the European states &quot; collective views . &quot;
four years ago one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends cr@@ ashing before our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has once again adopted controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , to Hungary no one will be sent back . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , did not send refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;

&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary . &quot;
your destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet agreed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new trial for binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the countries with the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , and announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who wanted to protect them , too . &quot;
&quot; but those who have no perspective , cannot remain in Germany either . &quot;
this view was clearly divided into the round .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort of strength . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck meanwhile on the Balkans route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania had to be restored with a fence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot;
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats depar@@ ting from Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; according to witnesses reported in Turkey , thousands of immigrants reported on the way to the Greek border . &quot;

&quot; this movement is only small , but still too large for a transparent cel@@ esti@@ al body , in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( USA State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers are presenting their analyses in the field of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn in 2006 , fed the steam and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained of pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis is scheduled for four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ der loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to pon@@ der now , &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün about the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , with a view of the possible commitment of a united pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties presented a de@@ fen@@ gres@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg . &quot;

but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ go contain relatively much sugar - suc@@ rose above all .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and pleas@@ antly smell . &quot;
&quot; the shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ go can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should store at room temperature and consume within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , taste pure or sweet dishes . &quot;
but a man@@ go gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ates like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex met previous arrangements for the Christmas business last year . &quot;

&quot; on Wednesday and at night to Thursday , the fle@@ a blows partly with a storm force through the fo@@ ehn . &quot;
&quot; after con@@ cili@@ ating on Thursday morning , we cross a marked cold front , which brings powerful rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
&quot; on the north side of the Alps , the cave breaks through the valleys on the night to Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning in the valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can pass through to the adjacent middle of the Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even or@@ kan@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ ehn offer summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine slope . &quot;
here the rain stops that lasts until Thursday night .
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this has to be reck@@ oned with large ra@@ inf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the fle@@ a leaves the air , as a result , a cold front with strong , partly ge@@ wit@@ ted rain from west to east through Switzerland is rolling . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind is refreshing to stor@@ my , and temperatures are going back clearly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honored as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working fellowship of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live only in sec@@ rec@@ y over the centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the pl@@ aza becomes visible in the symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a saying sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions allowed him to forti@@ fy him in his later battle against Rome in his later battle .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the sewage trade .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown crown is one of the major works of Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updates Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpretations of scrip@@ tural stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that focus on themes such as cross paths , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he has spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who , on the basis of painting , has dealt with the respective Bible passages . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into present , in current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors by Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original quot@@ a of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on each situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Orden . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work up , perhaps to bring me back to the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second aim is to re @-@ help art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising , and it is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers fall into the images , let them work , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture seeks his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost held on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art . &quot; I like how he stri@@ ves life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the most important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it concerns the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas models - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on 15 November . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is coming
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ts model@@ ed for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration ensured a breach , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus , hill slo@@ ped , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will enter in October , the first congregation of the congregation Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further remembrance &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga counts a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
football respon@@ ds to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politicians to help cope with the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s Office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wanted to help .
but the crucial course must put the policy .
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; explains Nier@@ sbach at the fr@@ ing@@ es of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will take the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes on everybody , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we soccer @-@ states can , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Sa@@ ver spoke of a &quot; prominent mark of the league . &quot;
&quot; for the Euro quali@@ fier game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Nier@@ sbach was supporting the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licenses in their own locations would have started their own projects is great .
it &apos;s just as great that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the associations have already called up all the total for 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : Chairman of the Executive Board of SAP loses one eye in case of an accident
&quot; the Chief of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he was on a water@@ front after midnight , which he had worn in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then came out tow@@ ing on the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP Central in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , when you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Sp@@ are Pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen beside skir@@ mis@@ h ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; in Singapore on weekends , he also received little as a reserve driver for the two pedi@@ gre@@ es Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button In@@ quiry , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League will finally collapse . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top Game against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we anticip@@ ate a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high loading of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his regular el@@ eventh position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of b@@ art@@ ender novel Bür@@ k@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left the door open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ceful statement of fellow players Re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , Mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Rob@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany is to be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing cars . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the home of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which will include investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries that come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication . &quot;
testing new technology is currently underway on the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to avoid the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; check the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use international for example , that the maximum speed allowed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the person as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in the event of automated driving , the car is increasing the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , cordless vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey conducted by the digital alliance Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , that in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , in traffic 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car in control under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current status of the title , the Düsseldorf wants to strike only in singles from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision is to fall at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to take the title even without Timo , &quot; said German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ Seminar in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing appointment in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer as a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; said Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also missed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the def@@ ender was hit by a tac@@ kling of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with it that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation September 18th . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work for which much effort was carried out : to fres@@ hen up the dolls , for example a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
14 tons of material supplied the makers according to the dict@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashion attempts by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his t@@ ed@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later joined the fashion designer himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as Mode N@@ ic
&quot; in the past , it was about the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in a large quantity for customers , which they processed for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ aries P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans on past styli@@ stic periods is an increasing order potential . &quot;
who does not operate in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
private specialty stores and wholes@@ alers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer on this path .
&quot; today , mass goods are manufactured in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively sold via chains . &quot;
&quot; exports are also weaker , currently after Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecological and socially sustainable . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Bran@@ ch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories , who have to think most economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine rocks small ch@@ icks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ smith Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ ball point for their jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says . &quot;
&quot; they also deliver to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a souvenir . &quot;
with this I see my jewelry as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open broad@@ ly to boost growth , said President Xi J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a set of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabit@@ ant &apos;s system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legally @-@ state business environment and stream@@ lines the market , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activity , and use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , and thus stimulate the consumers a significantly higher dose of the drugs . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ Watch , who has a corresponding EU working paper , sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ used industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ Watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ z@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous @-@ toxic for large fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish for economic reasons . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly charged with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ fish may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be im@@ pol@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ World@@ watch this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the sin@@ king of Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de dist@@ rac@@ tions manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt explained . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans .
&quot; for this reason , the Federal Government war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; small amounts can be produced especially in inf@@ ants of the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is primarily due to coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants run out more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total volume consumed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been cited in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings of mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
