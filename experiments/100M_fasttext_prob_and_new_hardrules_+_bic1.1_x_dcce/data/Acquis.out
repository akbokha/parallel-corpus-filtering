B ) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on assets shall be limited to the minimum required for the application of securing measures concerning nuclear material , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) At the request of the Community , the organisation is prepared to check the investment data that the Community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not require the organization to be delivered materi@@ ally , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) The organization ob@@ tains the consent of the Community and the states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II . if the Community aboli@@ sh@@ es either a proposed nom@@ ination or at any time against a ensu@@ ing appointment , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; III ) If due to the repeated refusal of the Community , to agree to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors of the organization that are hin@@ dered on the basis of this agreement , the Council recalls the refusal , after the General Director of the Organization - in the following as the &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; - dealt with the purpose of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their agreement , can actually perform their duties . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organisation are arranged in such a way that i ) are as low as possible for the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and dis@@ ruption of the Community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities that are subject to inspection ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information provided to the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including their assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials demanding tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this agreement are terminated with regard to nuclear material , if the community and the organization determine that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a manner that it is no longer usable for nuclear activity , which is no longer usable or virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the Community noti@@ fies the transfer of nuclear material from the States which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated in relation to the core material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken over responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents , from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re @-@ application of the backup measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association with the organization is intended to be used by the organisation of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this agreement regarding this material . &quot;
II ) that the not@@ ch material is not used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention not for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives .
B ) The organization and community make a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied only as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the provision defines how long and under what circumstances these securing measures cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be re @-@ applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is kept up to date on the total quantity and composition of the material in question in the State or States concerned , and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as soon as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural terms and agreements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or an understanding of the military activity and does not refer to the resulting use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the execution of their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , the States or the individuals who are subject to their sovereign power , however , are liable to extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has agreed beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the protection of liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organization and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of states . &quot;
&quot; any claim to which the Community or a state vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the Community or to a state due to damages , with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , is governed by international law in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; after checking the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council will ensure that the organisation is not able to ensure that no core material which has to be covered by the Convention for Nu@@ clear We@@ ap@@ ons or other nuclear explo@@ sives can be reimbur@@ sed for the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account what extent has been achieved by the applied securing measures , and provides the Community or the State - as far as each of the two contractual parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be reviewed by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes , an assessment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or of a decision taken by the Council shall be disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and shall be annex@@ ed to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal on the request of a party , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth , who pres@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and States or the Organisation have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within three days of the request for an arbit@@ ration request , the Community or the Organization shall seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the Treaty and members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the State of the Organisation has been notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) if the community of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its securing measures with respect to that state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other at the request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the Community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization by any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
this Convention shall enter into force on that day in which the organization of the Community and States receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States are contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when carrying out the provisions of the Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safety measures established in this Convention is the timely discovery of the turno@@ ff of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence of such a branch by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; in order to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the inspections by the organisation is performed by an explanation , in which material quantity is not specified for a certain period of time , stating the level of accuracy for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their review , the organization makes full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as it is necessary , to see how they are determined in the supplementary agreements more closely and function@@ ally : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , sent , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and quantities ; &quot;
B ) assessing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and assessment of differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ; &quot;
e ) Proced@@ ure for assessing the accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; ( g ) Ret@@ ur@@ ns , which ensure that the accounting practices and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , will inform the organization of the quantity and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not authorised or desired , the organization and community should consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this agreement , from these securing measures , provided that the entire material quantity delivered in the states is at no time greater than the total material quantity delivered in the states . &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular fol@@ dable material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is less than 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons depl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; should the delivered nuclear material be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are met on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are required in the scope , which is required for the successful and effective joint tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in the individual as to the procedures laid down in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without changing the Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements come into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organization provides a conden@@ sed inventory of the total core material contained in the states irrespective of its origin , and carries on this inventory of inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their review . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource @-@ transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the EEC and Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entering into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is pur@@ pos@@ ely intended to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organisation arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; Special Inter@@ action Account , &quot; which consists of the funds provided by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to by the organization as a &quot; administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ sensitive notes of the member state which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited in the organization &apos;s deposit in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be effected in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after entering into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator at the time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may make payments before the above dates upon request .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , the administrator proceeds approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school supplies to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to compensate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
( III ) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loans without discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned may be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly @-@ paid development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the financing programme of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the objectives of the organization financed by the organization ( b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction account must not be used instead of subordin@@ ate funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment terms that apply to the development loans granted by the organization in general ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in ten years respectively in 50 years . &quot;
transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this tim@@ e@@ out are to be paid directly to the organization that it retains .
&quot; each special transaction is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated . &quot;
&quot; income from any special transaction loan may be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services , which are made ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and that , according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted , may be recipients of a special loan . &quot;
the return of capital rep@@ ay@@ ments from a special transaction is to the special transaction account and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state must be returned to the member state as soon as possible from the administrator to the respective Member State .
&quot; until full assignment of all special transaction loans , the administrator regularly informs the EEC about the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transaction loan , the Administrator informs the E@@ WG four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made there@@ for . &quot;
the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account conclusion .
&quot; after payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible sends a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts recei@@ vable from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the account , and the amounts paid out of the account , and the rep@@ ay@@ ments to the Member States are obvious . &quot;
the EEC and the administrators are working closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to complete issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of thoughts about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special action plans and about any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the organization may agree , so the agreement and all obligations of the parties ensu@@ ing with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties with immediate effect shall be terminated . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States specify the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures in question .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these Noti@@ fications with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each word is equally authentic . &quot;
whereas the agreement was concluded in the form of a letter change to am@@ end the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - HA@@ T issued the following UN@@ DER@@ OR@@ D@@ MEN@@ TS :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation on the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ã@@ IS@@ CHE atomic community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large testing facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a Joint Enterprise in accordance with Chapter V of Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area in question . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is still to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research work , which , due to the energy crisis , has reached a higher priority level - &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable each contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit by pooling its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and thus to achieve the common goal of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ effectively competitive electricity production by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss program will take over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or changed after examination by the organs named in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , which may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; every time the contracting parties accept a new program , this is the place of the programmes listed in Annex I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 shall be realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the concerned laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project within the scope of the present agreement .
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 , 1 of this Agreement , the contracting parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those established between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s joint venture at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom ensures that Switzerland &apos;s contractual partner may become contractual partners of any contract , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies responsible for the implementation of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 of 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the association agreement provides , in particular , the establishment of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research work and thus direct the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group , which is used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , who has provided the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of Eur@@ atom &apos;s program , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with respect to all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and arran@@ ges their validity in the interests of the two contractual parties to the common goal defined in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme , as well as to the scientific and technological developments that are emerging in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek it . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Groups , which provide VG research proposals to ensure the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom program , take this task with respect to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the laboratories involved . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors who over@@ sees the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for optimally utili@@ sing the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , shall apply this task in relation to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the staff and for the exchange of it between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the sessions of all the coordin@@ ating committees set up within the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the Committee of Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees , which provide the Committee of Directors with appropriate proposals for the best possible use of resources , personnel and knowledge and skills on which the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , are perc@@ ei@@ ving this task in relation to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a responsible representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country for the core and energy research . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the Commission consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and possible changes in the orient@@ ations as well as the preparation of future programmes and the definition of their overall volume , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Committee of Directors , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have an advisory character . &quot;
the attitude of the VG to the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contractual parties work on the works of all technical advis@@ ors or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland at the Eur@@ atom program in accordance with this agreement is set annually on an amount equal to the share at the cost of Eur@@ atom &apos;s program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Switzerland to the whole Gross Dom@@ estic Product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Joint Enterprise as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland re@@ jects an amount to the Common Business of J@@ ET , which is to be determined in accordance with the financial provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Business . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of works within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis which is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works that are made on the basis of the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission informs the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount is fores@@ een to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program for the year . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
July . the remaining payment methods for Switzerland and Eur@@ atom financial contributions in accordance with this Article are determined in Annex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures to ensure that Eur@@ atom &apos;s duties and restrictions are exemp@@ t from the portion of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , or acquired items may not be promised either un@@ paid or free of charge in this country , unless approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to he@@ gemon@@ y and mor@@ als that are paid to these persons .
&quot; the provisions governing access to the knowledge stipulated in Articles 2 of 1 of the present agreement shall be governed by Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on the Exchange of Human Resources . &quot;
the provisions governing access to the knowledge required for Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Common Business J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ utes of the Common Company .
the right of each contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .

the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit transactions with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks ask for a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreements could be made up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future funds in the member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions are already mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; at any stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as on their possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first deduc@@ tions would not be made prior to the end of a month after the conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if BI@@ Z has to obtain the necessary funds on the market , the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum , which corresponds to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin . &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
&quot; I am honored to refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations regarding the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; within the framework of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in dead@@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement Argentina , through appropriate procedures , undertake to ensure that the actual amount of the year actually does not exceed the agreed quantity and / is executed in accordance with the conventional proposal forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the proposal form be made possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under Number 10 in order to find a suitable solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protective clause , it obli@@ ges them to ensure that Argentina &apos;s access to the community market regulated by this agreement is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products covered by this agreement to a minimum rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; upon entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the quantity set in number 2 corresponding to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the regulations of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the ho@@ op@@ ly rate of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity , known as number 2 , is determined with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of slaughter . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes all to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb at the community market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the conduct of the regulation , the sales of Argent@@ inian hammer and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of allow@@ ances or other subsi@@ dy measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as of the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs shall be made only at prices and conditions which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities of export licenses specified in this agreement are issued for the products mentioned under the number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in its turn , the community under@@ takes to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the presentation of an export licence , which is given by the relevant authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods is wai@@ ved .
&quot; in implementing regulations , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community is informed in regular intervals the amounts given to export licenses ; these data may be en@@ rolled up to destination country if necessary . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the market conditions in these markets , including the conditions stated for the purpose mentioned under the number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement shall not be carried out according to the Community . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year will be determined in proportion to the full year of the year , and will take account of the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party , to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before the 1st of April 1984 with regard to changes that are deemed necessary . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor myself , on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat from New Zealand into the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a joint market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat . &quot;
acknowled@@ gement of the fact that the sheep @-@ economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it must be ensured that the normal market of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb is not impaired in these markets - I honor the following agreement :
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand will ensure access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
new Zealand ob@@ tains the assurance that the normal paragraph of its amm@@ el - and lamb &apos;s flesh is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actual volume of the year actually does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the set @-@ up amounts are carried out in conventional proposal forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community assures that New Zealand shall not be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the market of the Community .
&quot; should a change in the proposal form be made possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two contractual parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find a suitable solution . &quot;

&quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with the amounts stated in clause 2 , in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond those quantities . &quot;

&quot; in implementing regulations , it is also specified that the relevant New Zealand authority shall notify the competent authority of the Community at regular intervals for the export licenses ; these data may be en@@ rolled up to destination country if necessary . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market of both contracting parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions stated in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement not specified under the agreement shall be carried out according to the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual amount set in clause 2 applies to the period from January 1 to December 31 , 2006 . the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement will be determined in proportion to the full year of the year . &quot;

C ) which are not free from diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
&quot; the blood is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle by a closed , sterile tube system in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ elled before steri@@ lisation . &quot;
&quot; after the removal of the blood , the bottle is immediately to be closed and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantit@@ atively , the anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution must not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not be below 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system must be determined beforehand by the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor takes place by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .

&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood flow of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation sh@@ ams , the plas@@ m@@ ab@@ eration mixtures are to be taken which do not contain more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods which reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; the amount of fluid assumed by the production of plasma is to be added , and the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water that the amount of fluid from which it was produced corresponds ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance indicated on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ i@@ tions may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be tested on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution will be calculated exclusively in the volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B and Anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are drawn up . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ ali@@ zations is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ckers which are observed in a series of di@@ lution in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which the International standard preparations are available ( for the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ completely anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International Standard Suppl@@ ement ( See Bulletin of O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain 256 international units per ml per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ ent form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents indicated on the label is based on the results of the feasibility trials ; it is approved by the federal regulatory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
&quot; to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with dry re@@ agents ) can be added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance remains the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ ent or re @-@ dissolved serum .
&quot; the re@@ agents , whether in flu@@ ent form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments , gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents identified for international exchange should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally dy@@ ed as possible , at least until an international agreement has been established on a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are stored for so long to be stored in the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion ; the others represent the necessary aid to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective proportion in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; a black printed label is available on each individual container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for dissolution , &quot;
&quot; in addition , this label or label on the cart@@ on where the individual containers are located , or the instructions included in the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change if International standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;

&quot; in the turn of the Community within the action programme to strengthen the internal market , a uniform administration paper decided to introduce a uniform administration paper from 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in the calculation that it is appropriate to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a single administration paper , &quot;
&quot; in the assignment that this Convention shall not be interpreted in detail , that it exclu@@ des the contracting parties from their obligations from other international conventions - &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a unified administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a document ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method applicable in the transport between the contractual parties ( herein@@ after referred to as the shipment method ) . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ alities associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single paper , for which im@@ prints are to be used in Annex I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the injection paper serves as a registration or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - to be expressly requested to carry out the legislation in force in a contractual party , whose application should not be guaranteed with the sole use of the uni@@ denti@@ al document ; &quot;
&quot; - to be requested by the participants , so that they can apply to the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , even using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation of the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not present at a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete registration can be approved . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed with the consent of the relevant authorities for a periodi@@ c collection application , within the period specified by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use commercial paper instead of a single paper . &quot;

&quot; - allow the competent authorities to request the data required for the provision of the relevant form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of the applications , and , if necessary , without giving a written registration ; &quot;
&quot; to allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the applications , that the export , mail or import request is made either by entering the data into the data processing plant or if such a paper is not created ; &quot;
- to apply any facil@@ itation that was adopted by the Mix@@ ed Committee in the way of a resolution referred to Article 11 paragraph 3 .
&quot; ( 1 ) App@@ endi@@ ces II to this Convention shall be laid down in Annex II to the provisions governing the provision of the goods required during the export , shipping and import of goods . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) In accordance with paragraph 1 , the registration is always available in one of the official languages of the import land if it occurs in this country using other copies submitted to the customs office of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the registration copies required for each individual procedure of a commodity exchange between the contracting parties , which may be required for the provision of the form@@ alities in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 may not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective consi@@ gn@@ ments , the competent authorities may stipul@@ ate that the form@@ alities for the export and the shipping method can be made to one and the same pre @-@ press by means of the copies intended for these form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall be satisfied as far as possible from the fact that the information contained in the copies of the application is contained in the individual process sections . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure smooth commodity exchange between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries are looking for or - provided that they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance cannot be denied or rejected in whole or in part , if the sought @-@ after country of the view is that the administrative assistance may imp@@ air its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests , or harm a business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or rejection of the official assistance , the respective decision and its grounds shall be communicated in@@ conclu@@ sively to the respective country . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking administrative assistance , which could not afford it , it points to this circum@@ stance in its search for that circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained under paragraph 1 may only be used for the purposes of this Convention and enjoy the protection granted by the national law of the country , which it has received , for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these information may be used only with the written consent of the customs authority , which it has given , and subject to the restrictions imposed by this authority in any other way . &quot;
( 1 ) A Mix@@ ed Committee shall be used in which each contracting party is represented in this Convention .

( 3 ) The moder@@ ated Committee shall make amendments to the app@@ endi@@ ces to this Convention as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 ( 3 ) of the last line of thought .
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the Mix@@ ed Committee assumed a decision under the provision of the constitutional requirements , the decision , provided that no date is mentioned therein , shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party shall take appropriate measures to ensure effective and well @-@ balanced implementation of this agreement , whereby the need to be taken into account is to reduce the prob@@ abilities of incoming goods as far as possible and to provide satisfactory solutions for the application of the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
( 1 ) This agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and on the one hand as well as for the areas of the EF@@ TA countries on the other .
( 2 ) This agreement also applies to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the Princip@@ ality of the Swiss Con@@ federation is bound by a customs union agreement .

&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to facilitate comprehen@@ sion , comparing and evaluation of statistical data , especially those of international trade , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to reduce the costs resulting from the fact that goods in international trade traffic have to be newly designated , re @-@ rolled and re @-@ enco@@ ded in the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the unification of trade documents and the transfer of data , &quot;
&quot; in THE turn that the development of technology and the structures of international trade necess@@ it@@ ates significant changes to the Brussels Agreement of 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff scheme for the entry of the goods into the tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE turn that the amount of differentiation required by governments and the economy for customs and statistical purposes at present is far beyond that which is contained in the system to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing system , that the harmon@@ ised system should be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of various modes of transport , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing system , the harmon@@ ized system is intended to be included as far as possible into the systems used in the trade for the designation and encoding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing of the harmon@@ ised system to contribute to the possible close relationship between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN THE turn that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ised system and the International Invent@@ ory of Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations shall be preserved , &quot;
&quot; in the calculation that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined customs tari@@ ff and statistical modeling , which is appropri@@ ated for the use by those involved in international trade , &quot;
it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of the technology and the structures of international trade .
taking into account the work carried out by the Council for Cooperation in the Cust@@ oms Sector for the Harmon@@ ised System in this area ;
&quot; in THE turn that - although the aforementioned agreement on the tari@@ ff scheme proved to be an effective tool to achieve some of these goals - the conclusion of a new international agreement is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot;

the contracting parties of the Agreement signed on 15 December 1950 concerning the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the Cust@@ oms Sector
it is desirable that the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods on 1 January 1988 came into force in Brussels on 14 June 1983 .
&quot; in the weighing , that without a change in Article 13 of the aforementioned Convention , the date of the entry into force of this Convention would remain uncertain - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , paragraph 1 receives the following version : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement shall come into force on 1 January , following the exp@@ iry of at least three months immediately following the date of which at least sevent@@ een of the states referred to in Article 11 signed the rati@@ fication or have deposited their rati@@ fication or accession certificates , but not before 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; A. This Protocol takes effect simultaneously with the Convention , provided at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ ons designated in Article 11 of the Convention concerning the adoption of the Protocol at the Council &apos;s General Sec@@ retariat for Cooperation in the Cust@@ oms Sector . &quot;
&quot; however , only states or customs or economic uni@@ ons can deposit the document on the acceptance of this protocol , which have previously signed the agreement without reservation of rati@@ fication or at the same time sign it or have deposited its certificate of rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention or at the same time . &quot;
&quot; B . any state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention according to the entry into force of this protocol according to paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version amended by the Protocol . &quot;
&quot; a plant which is indispensable not only for the maintenance and preservation of soils , but also the exploitation of land , which does not allow any other planting , and which makes the main part of today &apos;s production , favourable to any improvement in cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that of its cultivation depend on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which in turn are entirely dependent on the measures that are made to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in non @-@ generating consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that olive oil and table olive are essential ingredients in the areas in which olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that the essential characteristic of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producers &quot; income ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , this causes all particular difficulties that seriously damage the interests of producers and consumers and can end@@ anger the general policy of economic growth in countries that are in zones where the cultivation of olive trees is common ; &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F , the extraordinary importance of olive production for the economy of numerous countries , in particular the olive growing tree in development ; &quot;
&quot; in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that in view of the special conditions of olive growing and the market for olive products , the measures required for the national territory must go beyond and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
&quot; in view of the International O@@ live Convention of 1956 in its amended version , amended by the Protocol of 3 April 1958 and the International O@@ live Convention of 1963 in its amended and amended version and the International O@@ live Convention of O@@ live 1979 ; &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M BE@@ W@@ US@@ ST@@ SE@@ IN that it is essential to continue and develop the work begun within the framework of the Con@@ ventions , and that it is desirable to close a new Convention - &quot;

&quot; remember that the executive body recognized the need for the Convention on its second session to effectively reduce the annual total emissions of nitrogen ox@@ ides from stationary and movable springs or their gr@@ en@@ fe@@ ver@@ ging river until 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing emissions of nitrogen ox@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen ox@@ ides and their follow @-@ on products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions , &quot;
&quot; determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen ox@@ ides or its bur@@ dening flow , in particular by applying appropriate national emission thres@@ holds for new mobile large stationary sources , as well as upgrading existing large existing sources , &quot;
&quot; in the knowledge that the scientific and technical knowledge of these issues will develop , and that this development must be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further measures , &quot;
&quot; recognizing that the formulation of a solution based on critical burdens has the aim of creating an effective scientific basis , which must be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further internationally agreed measures , &quot;
