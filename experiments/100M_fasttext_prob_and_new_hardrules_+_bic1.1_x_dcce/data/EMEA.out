this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder where the patients have episodes of normal mood alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems when oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for taking or treating the enam@@ el tablets in patients who are experiencing difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are de@@ composed as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to normal@@ ising the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents its recur@@ r@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , preventing the occurrence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies spann@@ ing up to a year . &quot;
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased tur@@ mo@@ il over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased tur@@ mo@@ il , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
in all studies the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled tick ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting ( increased s@@ ali@@ vation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were based on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were based on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; increased pot@@ ency in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing to m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be cau@@ ti@@ ously applied in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with conv@@ ul@@ sions .
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ am@@ ic , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain generally is observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ i bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism . &quot;
&quot; considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose @-@ height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for human safety and the concerns originating in the reproduction studies in animal studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ism , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurred compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ surgery treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sp@@ ines@@ ia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ si@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ er@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor @-@ lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ amen , showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor @-@ lig@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients , who held a response to study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se compared to 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
&quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a lasting effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed an superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ness is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the average Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l on extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cin loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate Kon@@ ju@@ gate hydro@@ xy@@ - arith@@ me@@ tic found no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can take the enam@@ el tablets as an alternative to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavi@@ ours belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders were reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sp@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l .

&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed an superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at recommended clinical trials . &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can take the enam@@ el tablets as an alternative to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
late dy@@ sp@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared to a 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole solution in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets amounted to 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 In addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by avoiding adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a continu@@ ative oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sp@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ am@@ ic , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain generally is observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ i bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ si@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly applied as a single @-@ use , while simultaneously receiving lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose @-@ height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular received , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the one given by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those treated with lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ stages ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sp@@ ines@@ ia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements in ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for Plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected as a result of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients , who held a response to study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se compared to 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed an superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study lasting more than 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
in 2 studies with healthy subjects the mean time to reach the maximum plasma gas was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which were in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular in 15@@ - and 5 @-@ times above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
&quot; in studies of reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns occurred after mat@@ ernal exposure , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; they have only limited or no significance for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cin loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ fold the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine about three quarters earlier . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug contained in a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; viewed only those patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time and disease wor@@ sen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited Company a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of m@@ amma @-@ carcin@@ oma in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to Grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data for recommendations of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that may have essentially other pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ants is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity clearly associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient &apos;s collective are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea in the patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ tious methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or at child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
male patients should be advised about a sperm service prior to treatment because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic light and the ability to operate machines .
listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue @-@ burning , dry mouth , sore throat , loose chair , est@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest area , weakness of muscles , neck pain , muscle pains , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in connection with a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bu@@ le indi@@ genes and stabili@@ ses mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ ple@@ zation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sit@@ ial cell transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 night@@ mare receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor area due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ uted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two un@@ affiliated trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 for an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in relation to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients , who experienced a peripheral Neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the treatment . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 has been established in clinical studies .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took off in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high volume of distribution points to a wide @-@ ranging ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metabo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; over 75 years of age , however , only a few data are available since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was documented at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and as with other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a surface of abrasion . &quot;
&quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the throughput bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wet@@ ting of the solid material . &quot;
then the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle should be til@@ ted slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete suspension of the powder occurs .
&quot; if counter@@ f@@ eit or sin@@ king agents are visible , the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle needs to be re @-@ inver@@ ted gently in order to achieve a complete suspension prior to the application . &quot;

&quot; if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines Please inform the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription medicine , as they may cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; in addition , they should be advised about a sperm conservation before treatment , because the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment is the possibility of lasting in@@ fertility . &quot;
road ti@@ ghtness and abrasion of machines Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the transport capacity and the ability to operate machines .

member states must ensure that the holder of the permit for the marketing will provide the medical specialist staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials prior to market launch :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . • With clear visual representation of the correct use of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport by the patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion if a blood @-@ blood don@@ or is not possible and a blood loss from 900 to 1 800 ml may occur .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to make a blood don@@ or , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the inj@@ ections can also be done by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have given adequate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; iron levels of all patients must be checked prior to treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been inserted , which em@@ powers it to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; when administered as an injection into a vein in the context of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , was compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were switched to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
&quot; being inj@@ ected under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Medi@@ c Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG agency approval for the transport of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular disease , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of larger operative procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood from 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ aes@@ thesia and fol@@ lic@@ ular symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease burden ; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
these clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ aes@@ thesia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease burden ; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required to control sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ verti@@ cu@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ verti@@ cu@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after a further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ cul@@ u@@ loid number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ verti@@ cu@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serving is required should receive ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to allow large iron reserves to be available before the start of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medication in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) under treatment should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ en@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian well @-@ known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the cardi@@ oid or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of pain , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be investigated and the common causes for non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ mag@@ in@@ toxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the recur@@ r@@ ential cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the ti@@ co@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes are normal , and if no other cause of a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration below section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit , which is due to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ines when the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control sei@@ zur@@ es and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration below section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for tumour patients under chemotherapy , an 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for assessing the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment , taking into account the specific patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients , which are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo an increased elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ al pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cul@@ inary events may exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine did not prove that patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy declined when a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose can be adjusted to the growing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
&quot; via th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ ne@@ ys@@ men , ret@@ ino@@ cul@@ os@@ clerosis ) . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can come to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
the genetically acquired epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ iled and identical with the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of the native patient .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ asis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;

survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality rate than in the controls performed with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin . &quot;
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these findings are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous administration showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and an extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 animal experimental studies with approximately the 20@@ x of the weekly average recommended for use in humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased flu@@ ffy body weight , a del@@ aying of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;

the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;

&quot; during treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells , which re@@ acts with further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary to control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , dissolution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed prior to treatment . &quot;
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria , he will ab@@ ort your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or ascending potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to present findings , the treatment of car@@ c@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 Your doctor will regularly determine your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) , and adjust your dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and under certain conditions may have a negative impact on the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if you have an or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking / applying / applying other medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given in 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ections yourself under the skin . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it may come - irrespective of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood c@@ rop@@ phy ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like in the case of stroke ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a may reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the first study involved almost 8 000 women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of up to five years .
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ construc@@ ts bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study of older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
the risk of hip frac@@ tures increased by 41 % compared to patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reaction to in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains clu@@ es as to how the medicine is applied , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of Ac@@ last@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk for frac@@ tures including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging contribution • Con@@ contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast @-@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Major signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ up@@ a is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available . &quot;
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
&quot; Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid intervention of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental procedures , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
the incidence of serious side @-@ effects reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 out of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was comparable between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as an acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured yearly prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum creation within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , showed in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of cit@@ ric acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area were investigated , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections , including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention . &quot;
7 patients with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with Ac@@ last@@ a and a patient treated with placebo .
&quot; in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral body frac@@ tures were significant over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
ac@@ last@@ a treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared with placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius significantly compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the scar@@ f by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic cavity were taken . &quot;
a micro@@ computer comp@@ uted ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in trab@@ ecular mes@@ h@@ work compared to placebo .
bone mar@@ row markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) and the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were specified in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ last@@ a was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment increased BM@@ D on the overall fragrances and scar@@ ves at all times . &quot;
&quot; over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment resulted in an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the overall fragrances and 4.3 % on the scar@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % with Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate based on the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , above all light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence compared with the initial value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate was observed after 6 months . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from 143 to Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic response could be maintained at 141 of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , during an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; then the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic van@@ ishing from the large cycle with half @-@ life @-@ times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long period of elim@@ inations with a termin@@ ological Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early mat@@ ur@@ ation phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clearing amounts to 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration at the time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearing of metabo@@ li@@ zed substances due to cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metabo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid requires .
&quot; since there are only limited data for severe kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal injection dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid was determined in rats by dos@@ ages of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ ption effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses starting from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and those of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced due to the lower serum @-@ calcium mirror . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ last@@ a is delivered as a pack with a bottle as a packing unit or as a bundle of 5 packages , each containing a bottle . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk for frac@@ tures including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging contribution • Con@@ contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast @-@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , in the 1.@@ 8.1 module of the application application , the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the 1.@@ 8.1 module is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
Ris@@ ko management plan The holder of approval for placing on the market under@@ takes to carry out the studies and additional activities to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance which are presented in the risk management plan of the adopted version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all of the following versions of the R@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for phar@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ isation ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone remo@@ del@@ ing is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ last@@ a works by normal@@ ising the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation , giving back strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff when you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / apply , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines which is known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with foods and drinks , you are concerned that you have sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; since Ac@@ last@@ a is active for a long time , you may need another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before ending treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a If you consider the termination of treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) but less frequent after subsequent in@@ fusion .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; at present , it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or de@@ af feeling , especially around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; swelling , in@@ som@@ nia , ti@@ redness , ting@@ ling , swelling , stomach upset , pain relief , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , stomach upset , stomach pain , swelling , stomach upset , irrit@@ ation , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue wa@@ v@@ ature and thirst . &quot;
continued pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects you listed may be significantly impaired or you notice any side effects not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to carry out the in@@ fusion of acet@@ last@@ a two or more weeks following surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid intervention of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ compli@@ a is used to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , and also one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies for setting the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among other things in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable when applying A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ an@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ compli@@ a in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight cuts
medicines used in patients who require it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) and around the Ar@@ z
he ad@@ mits to diet and exercise for treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) who also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive symptoms or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used for depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case exceeds the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides the obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;

• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) before less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

over@@ weight patients and patients with obesity have been examined and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ates ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;

&quot; in a tolerance study , in which a limited number of persons were given one @-@ time charges of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia at the same time .

&quot; patients treated with A@@ compli@@ a 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ compli@@ a and placebo -@@ 4,@@ 2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 weight reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients with no diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2- diabetes ( seren@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was after 6 months -@@ 0.@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under Plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference between the average weight variation between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and explained about 50 % through weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z

&quot; 5.3 Pre @-@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse effects that were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human @-@ therapeutic field , were assessed as potentially relevant for the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress appears to be connected to the animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or menstru@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post @-@ nat@@ al development , an exposure to the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diab@@ etic drug ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another diab@@ etic medication ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) that cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acceptable dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ or or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ amide or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , which means that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced when using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ser showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos additionally showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ge@@ tic ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirrors - blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that ac@@ tos be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence for Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited Company . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated primary liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T = 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked . &quot;
the decision whether to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment up to the basis of laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which may arise from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot;
a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ or or dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients talk about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be removed ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not exercise relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ ins@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
&quot; very frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not available from present data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ an@@ asc@@ ents above the three @-@ fold upper limit of the standard range often appear as under placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative medications . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) treated patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to have a rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated by the activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ al production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to study the time until the treatment of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficiently set with insulin , despite three months of optimization , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to bas@@ eline values was seen throughout the year . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ e@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under the pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while values reduced under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized into groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma generally 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in approximately the triple of the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the fur ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation @-@ Age of imm@@ utable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies performed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , hyper@@ ins@@ an@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tumours . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
another study about two years examined the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ sia .
&quot; in clinical trials for more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to bas@@ eline values was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study lack@@ ed the goal regarding their primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation over the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and from more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , there was an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level of post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; on the prescription label of the drug , name and address of the manufacturer that is responsible for the release of the relevant batch must be given . &quot;
&quot; in September 2005 , the pharmaceutical business owner will submit an additional 6 month periodi@@ c periodi@@ c safety update report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) and then submit annual P@@ SU@@ R@@ s , up to a different decision of CH@@ MP . &quot;
an updated risk management plan must be submitted according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use .
&quot; if you are suffering from type 2 diabetes , Ac@@ tos give 15 mg tablets the control of your blood sugar level by bringing about better use of the body &apos;s own insulin . &quot;
&quot; if you are aware that you are suffering from a sugar intoler@@ ance , please contact your doctor before taking Ac@@ tos in 15@@ mg tablets . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or until recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you take Ac@@ tos 15 mg tablets in combination with other medicines to treat diabetes ( such as insulin , chlor@@ prop@@ amide , gli@@ ben@@ cl@@ amide , g@@ lic@@ la@@ sia , tol@@ ar@@ amide ) , your doctor will tell you if you need to reduce the dose of your medicines . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and heart disease or earlier stroke , which were treated with Ac@@ tos and insulin , heart failure developed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies where pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was compared with other oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics or placebo ( active @-@ free tablets ) , women ( but not in men ) who took Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one showed a higher number of frac@@ tures . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ eg@@ els suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is included in the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks associated with diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit issued to Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to promote Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly , for example , by an intensified insulin therapy , can detect hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients who reported hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; prior to journeys that go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the doctor has to take into account potential interactions in therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines that are taken by them . &quot;

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; therefore , diab@@ e@@ tics should always have grape pieces , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a single @-@ weight assistant or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum amount is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mix of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

&quot; aden@@ o@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atism ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first months of treatment , rheum@@ atism can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ o@@ ic treatment are still used for the prevention of rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ o@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ o@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day in the last three measurements had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ o@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardiac complaints in the pre@@ history , there may also be increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ o@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but could also have a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ ate deposits ( including a known or currently actual g@@ out node and / or rheum@@ at@@ arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into account every day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in children and adolescents the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
&quot; since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ ological medicines , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the treatment , because of the reduction of the serum acid secre@@ tion , ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobili@@ sed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases can increase so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to beginning of the tissue treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings and clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ was did not perform male menop@@ aus@@ al studies at F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; subjects were associated with the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ of@@ aci@@ d / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study of subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid du@@ ms containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and slow@@ ed down the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the reported cardiovascular events was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ac@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could appear in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , no severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated in 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related during the long @-@ term surveys were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and were reported in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the data . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ ot@@ es@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin colour , Bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , erectile dysfunction , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises as part of hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin - ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a powerful non Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT Study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum of serum cancer at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0@@ mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum cancer values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) received , were summ@@ ar@@ ised for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering the serum acid sa@@ p to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) has been observed during the medical visit week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cancer &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D ) .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels increased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , resulting in less than 3 % of patients ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a de@@ watering ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the ge@@ aring size , resulting in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out k@@ not until month 24 . &quot;
&quot; elevated TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) , and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 m@@ g. dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2,@@ 8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma rotation of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are formed predominantly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the total dose was found in urine ( 3 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the stool as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to patients with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean overall AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 m g . / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m g . / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After ing@@ es@@ tion of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility in male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately 11 @-@ times the exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in high doses , approximately 3 @-@ 3 times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction in the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ ower and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 4.3 times and with carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposition , do not have ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

an updated R@@ MP is to be submitted according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk management • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( phar@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ isation ) • on demand of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .

&quot; if you have a rheum@@ atism at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the rheum@@ atism is cleared before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , when you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be you other medicines if necessary in order to prevent a rheum@@ atism or treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking / applying / applying other medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than for those who were excluding Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data that demonstrate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ c@@ ers ) , ag@@ ul@@ ence ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic bre@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in case of diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. permission to launch AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be taken only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following references are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or put the tablet in the mouth , as there should be a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , be given only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strokes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially they were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms indicating possible malign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be pointed out in the appearance of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn to seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions should be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men mainly contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available that give indications of whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a max@@ illary surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning while taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned at the planned day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in clinical trials was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis was also reported . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the serum @-@ calcium intake increased up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , est@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of calcium and phosph@@ ate , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; severe cases may cause a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y , and thus to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

&quot; after 15 weeks AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic D &lt; 3@@ 2.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs . &quot;
the therapeutic equ@@ valence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in the Phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3,@@ 2 % compared to placebo 6.1 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to adhere to ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; it consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day for 2 years and subsequently 10 m@@ g. a day either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption Oc@@ curr@@ ing an intraven@@ ous reference dose , mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after child@@ like fasting and two hours before the start of a standardized breakfast . &quot;
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active ingredient was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fur . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) , after child@@ like fasting and two hours before intake of a meal , the average area below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 was 29@@ 6.@@ 4 n@@ g • h / ml ( without consideration of endo@@ genous vitamin D3 mirrors ) . &quot;
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ x@@ ated in the liver to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic D3 and then in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form , metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine was 2.4 % in urine after 48 hours , in the F@@ ä@@ ces after 4 days , 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there is no clinical data available , it is nevertheless to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; for patients with reduced kidney function , there is a slightly increased risk of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft , as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , comparing Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , time @-@ consuming further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t have been performed and studied how Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , as the Ad@@ dan@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken simultaneously must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and daily dosage ; ren@@ dition@@ ing of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level conditions ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as a table mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in order to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post transplantation phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the Ad@@ dan@@ ra@@ f can last several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient does not allow oral intake of medicines during the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustment can be required later because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Ad@@ dan@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily dose in the morning .
recommended dosage - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be changed a gra@@ ft recipient of twice daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the entire daily dose .
&quot; after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Ad@@ dan@@ ra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must commen@@ ce for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . &quot;
&quot; heart transplan@@ t In adult patients , who are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , came to an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in transplan@@ t transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood tal@@ low levels in the desired area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
&quot; since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular provision of the serum cre@@ atine in@@ insp@@ iegel , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the basin level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level control .
&quot; it is recommended to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; the blood @-@ level mirror of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to ad@@ vaginal , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the tac@@ tile level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in whole blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and daily dosage ; ren@@ dition@@ ing of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f formulation . &quot;
&quot; in order to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ary mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies can be avoided during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ary concentrations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed to observe chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore occur also under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; as Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , special care is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ary blood levels , while the addition of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; hence the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , it is recommended to monitor the new@@ born on any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ born , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , is often elevated in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ ozo@@ ale ) . &quot;
cases of virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal Leu@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us cannot be di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are likely to be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ite protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular memory . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ eration of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the T cells dependent proliferation of the B cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; the overall safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic corneal gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ary and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us it came in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ al ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ um@@ er@@ ated by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ ge 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;

&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplantation showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ ist gra@@ fts ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation .

&quot; adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advances are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA :
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been inserted , which em@@ powers it to the formation of the human scent factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; was assessed . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; advances may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human tann@@ ing factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence for placing lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II @-@ defici@@ encies , according to the place and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II @-@ activity in the corresponding period is not to sink below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment process , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for the control of the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , reaching different in vi@@ vo recovery and having different half @-@ value lives . &quot;
&quot; 3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding with an appropriate dose is not controlled , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dosage velocity should be directed after the patient has been found , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always immune to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the degree of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic inhibit@@ ory development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the clearing @-@ rate revealed adequate values again on the 15th day of the day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) had a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or ( ≥ 50 days ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial consisted of 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred that showed an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported to have reported cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ co@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ ous gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported over hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for activating factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the first authorization , CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for a further extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company will withdraw its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically altered in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient before , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of under@@ growth , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP examined the answers of the company on the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours will bring benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether taking back consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all loc@@ ust symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who recorded pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients with aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who alone took des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mou@@ th@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines to treat allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should also not be used in patients who suffer from con@@ genital glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension caused stroke ) , or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms begin .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term waste can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment may be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if required . &quot;
&quot; since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ olit@@ ano , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this group of patients and the data did not suff@@ ice to indicate appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment must be removed in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ ache ) . &quot;
&quot; treating patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be dis@@ car@@ ded at least 48 hours before the treatment of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise inhi@@ bit positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce it to its extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not raise the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic ability or the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , A@@ tax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules p @-@ sel@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard met@@ rics of flight performance including strengthening subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the fluid equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on Day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ u@@ vial administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure following an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its constitu@@ ents , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; since March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or diagnosed with you using aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ asing , heart beat • nausea and head@@ ache or strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you take a@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
use in recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to he@@ ade@@ dness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform instantly your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you listed may significantly imp@@ air you or notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .

&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; efficacy was measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptom number ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both trials at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in teenagers from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease progression and can be ended after the symptoms end and can be res@@ um@@ ed during their re@@ occurring .
the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly reported side effects , reported more frequently than placebo , were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules p @-@ sel@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard met@@ rics of flight performance , including strengthening subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification into seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively less@@ ens the load caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively rec@@ alled by chronic patients . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine treatment is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ ti@@ stic diseases , it is expected that , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is also caused by other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ co@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rant at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and being awake as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of mac@@ ad@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n did not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies showed that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical trials conducted by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , allevi@@ ating symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under the age of 2 are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabo@@ li@@ zed by the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which metabo@@ li@@ zes metabo@@ li@@ zed , is the same as for children who metabo@@ li@@ ze normal . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily average of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically di@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not cause any impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol neither to increase the alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown according to the overall scores of the questionnaire regarding quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ co@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rant at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian people ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the si@@ rup formulation of children aged between 2 and 11 years , with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are limited . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ accumulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were compared with recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ in@@ blown bottles with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate can be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate was well tolerated . this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in the context of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .

&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 m@@ g. did not affect standard measurement parameters including the reinforcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively less@@ ens the load caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side @-@ effects between the Si@@ rup@@ - and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for the engaging formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ dosage studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which metabo@@ li@@ zes metabo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children who metabo@@ li@@ ze normal . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems such as fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants from 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , for a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification into seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as shown according to the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian people ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;

&quot; if you miss the intake of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet If you forgot to take your dose in time , take it as soon as possible and then follow the normal treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; after market launch of A@@ eri@@ us , very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) and skin rash . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us solution for beginners is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included . &quot;
&quot; if the solution is attached to an application sy@@ ringe for preparations to take @-@ in with sc@@ aling , you can use it alternatively in order to take the appropriate amount of solution . &quot;
&quot; regarding the treatment duration , your doctor will determine the kind of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you are suffering from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution . &quot;
&quot; however , in children less than 2 years diarr@@ ho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia were common side effects during adults fatigue , mou@@ th@@ wash and head@@ ache more often than with placebo reported . &quot;
&quot; 97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for insertion is available in bottles with child @-@ safe cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
the 150 ml package size is a measuring spoon or application sy@@ ringe for preparations for insertion with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the Company will withdraw its application from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against the flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic erup@@ ts when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human because human beings have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign @-@ body &quot; &quot; and makes antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies faster in a contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the membrane cover of the virus was dis@@ connected with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface detected by the human body as a foreign body ) , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in taking part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be as@@ cer@@ tained if the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient before , and the likel@@ ihood is that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily that are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ generic , which was dil@@ uted in low doses , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but A@@ generic was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the A@@ generic anti @-@ viral viral load was as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 16 @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generic term may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; amo@@ is may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded just like a@@ gener@@ a and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking a@@ gener@@ a are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ generic drugs were predomin@@ ated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years against the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of a@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available for scientific reasons at the time of approval . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) treated adults and children from 4 years of age . &quot;
&quot; for general , A@@ generic medicines are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the enhancing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of amo@@ is in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generic drugs should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
a@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the ing@@ es@@ tion of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that amo@@ eba or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ generation does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for general , A@@ generic capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
&quot; for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , which are metabo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential use of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supp@@ res@@ sions of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under Monitoring the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the active ingredient concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , amo@@ is may be less effective because of the reduced plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to evaluate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given up with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ e content of the A@@ generic solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other groups of patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be pos@@ ited for a duration of 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ as@@ pi@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to whose therapy medicines were necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ angi@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical condition or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial a@@ eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeu@@ tical width amo@@ is must not be given simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeu@@ tical Wid@@ th A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly metabo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma mass by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver have been observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient has already received St. John &apos;s wort , the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ als and , if possible , check the viral load and add the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with amalg@@ am ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ri@@ z below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600@@ mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg were used twice a day proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment pattern . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of a@@ gener@@ a in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the f@@ anta@@ sies component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ generic are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ra in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once a day without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with as@@ gener@@ a , may result in interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines when applied in combination with a@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ generic , since it can cause res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous consumption of a@@ gener@@ a can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol declined by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels should be expected con@@ current at the same time . &quot;
&quot; as plasma level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a hab@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these pharmaceuticals with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with oral m@@ app@@ hi@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while the use of a@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is currently being given , such as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible use for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected , but it is not known if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by st@@ oning in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight in the post@@ age . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the descendants , including fertility and reproduction , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ generic ase was studied in adults and children older than 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most adverse events associated with A@@ generic treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the taking of a@@ generic drugs or any other medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1,@@ 200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and potential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ o@@ cal fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ acking ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated subjects treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean period of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ inous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared spontaneously within two weeks , without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to be broken off . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in cases of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception was the increase in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values obtained in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ mine Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells . &quot;
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described rarely have been observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates from 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , 3@@ 50@@ V , AS@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; companies who sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally intact . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients , with which a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early termination of a prescribed therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial where PI treated with PI ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven Virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ generic ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis observed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of untreated as@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 were pre@@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies A@@ generic solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was not a low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with a@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , treatment optimisation should be considered with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ affiliated Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which is the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ affiliated Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and A@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
&quot; even though the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , the effect of a kidney function disorder should be reduced to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these treatment schemes lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1,@@ 200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day , without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occur in male animals with dos@@ ages that correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the exposure to man , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , showed little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations at human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of amo@@ is nor after treatment . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ity studies , which were treated at the age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the animals and the animals treated with amalg@@ am cavi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the enhancing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under Monitoring the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the active ingredient concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic term should be delayed for a duration of 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600@@ mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ra in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol declined by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible use for the mother compared to possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by st@@ oning in the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the down@@ time . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ generic ase was studied in adults and children older than 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed at signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ mine Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , treatment optimisation should be taken into consideration in treatment with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ affiliated Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occur in male animals with dos@@ ages that correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the human exposure after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; toxic@@ ity studies , which were treated at the age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the animals and the animals treated with amalg@@ am cavi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in young the metabolism paths are not yet fully developed , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking in is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age . &quot;
the benefit of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ generic solution for taking in was neither confirmed in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a solution to intake and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination in these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ e content , A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated for small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that amo@@ eba or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with a@@ generation , does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under Monitoring the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the active ingredient concentration are available . &quot;

&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ angi@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;

&quot; simultaneous consumption of a@@ gener@@ a can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and result in side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be performed three times a week for six weeks . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is performed three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected skin areas , so that they remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before they are washed away . &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo performed either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • The total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p with immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) to apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible cow@@ l in the genital or peri@@ anal area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period treated the treated l@@ esi@@ ons only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient would like to apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bing into the clean@@ sed , with cow@@ ard infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a balance between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
these patients need to be weigh@@ ed between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , where no daily prior auth@@ oring was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a tri@@ mming leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; with an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous treatments applied to the treatment of external fo@@ etus in the genital and per@@ ine@@ al region , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicates an increased rate of exposure reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients regarding the removal of cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates available for more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapeutic forms should be considered in case of super@@ fi@@ gured bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rel@@ ap@@ sed and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended for previously untreated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arm and hands do not support effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong for the patient , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acne l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ulated properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although it is not possible to achieve quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly reported and likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream associated with adverse events in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treating the cow@@ war@@ ms ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported in a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III were reported below .
&quot; the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effect , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects reported in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; the evaluation of clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it often came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / leaves / scales ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation of clinical signs , fores@@ een according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and growth ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could result in nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been demonstrated after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior with respect to a complete healing of the cow@@ ard during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
60 % of all patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients completely ; this was 20 % of the patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary hyper@@ tex@@ tured bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lateral l@@ esi@@ ons , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne l@@ esi@@ ons within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ easy scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical symptoms after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external cow@@ ards , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the half @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ identifiable bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week induced no tumours in the application area .
&quot; the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , it is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream , earlier and in a larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology , using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over the age of 65 was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in a reasonable clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience in re@@ viewing the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions it must be cau@@ tious after a break of treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ gi@@ cs ) to be treated , in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion needs to be stopped until symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ence with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe form of treatment and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the treatment started , whereby the patients aged under the age of 5 usually came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until early departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients showed no det@@ ectable antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients in which it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 trial and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not appear to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug interactions , even if adverse drug reactions were typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in a recovery of enzyme activity in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells are absorbed into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 trial of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ga@@ it that is shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study had a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of G@@ AG &apos;s reflection was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; in regards to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes en@@ capsul@@ ate for five efficacy levels ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute det@@ achment , movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a 1 @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe cross @-@ country form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine per week 22 in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe cross @-@ lead form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were detected . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were carried out on the G@@ AG @-@ mirror in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute ga@@ it test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at age 5 was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with one @-@ off dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified as a particular threat to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies have been conducted , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to be stored , provided the di@@ lution took place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
5 ml concentrate for the production of a solution in a water bottle ( type I @-@ glass ) with stop@@ pers ( silicone @-@ chlor@@ ob@@ yl rubber ) and sealing ( aluminium ) with tear cap ( polypropylene ) .

&quot; the holder of approval for the placing on the market has to complete the following program within the given time , the results of which form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will cover long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which cle@@ ars certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ es ) , is incomplete or incomplete . &quot;
if you are allergic to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oil . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( appearance in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased metabolism • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion point &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available every year , and if necessary , the packaging contribution will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to be stored , provided the di@@ lution took place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of th@@ inn@@ able pi@@ erc@@ ing cylinders after body weight of the individual patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; an@@ e@@ tics &quot; &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose will be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form continues to be easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ ese othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7,@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival times when administration of A@@ lim@@ ta compared with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to promote the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each bottle of water must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of second @-@ line treatment of patients with either cross @-@ line advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after closure of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid in the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed administration and on the day after the treatment .
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake should be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood sample should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a plat@@ el@@ et of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood @-@ picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or combined with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so - on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical trials did not indicate that in patients at age 65 years of age or over , compared to patients aged 65 years , there is an increased side effect risk . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( if the liver metast@@ ases are present ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ants has reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ants , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the preceding cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , was om@@ itted when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treated toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients for treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity exists by p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised in advance of the treatment given to seek advice on the preservation of the sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to a reduced p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advised if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - x@@ ed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be used during pregnancy , except if necessarily - demanding and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity exists by p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be informed before the beginning of the treatment to seek advice on the blocking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is passed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed infant cannot be excluded .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple attack points by blocking the thym@@ us dy@@ nas@@ al syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , and the fol@@ ate key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ lin@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural she@@ ep@@ at@@ oth@@ i@@ oma , showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage over patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural retina was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in relation to the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a decrease in lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi@@ centre , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC showed a medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.3 versus 8.0 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a separate random@@ ised controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin require less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28@@ ,@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fusion ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients needed the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.0 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4,@@ 3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed after administration as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the dose is found within 24 hours of the application , unchanged in urine . &quot;
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total concentration of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al fun@@ tion ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs receiving intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us injection for 9 months were observed ( de@@ gen@@ e- ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) .
&quot; if not less applied , the retention times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C , unless the preparation / di@@ lution took place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
dissolve the contents of 100 mg / ml of sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives . this results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .

&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take allergy and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabo@@ li@@ se some fats in the food , causing roughly a quarter of the fats introduced with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study all@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in both studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study of allergy in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , weight loss could not be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco @-@ finish , stu@@ ds , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , clo@@ ak outlet , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which there are not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K on the entire European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction in adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical and gre@@ asy diet .
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;

the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase when all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy , because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic may need to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of these drugs must be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant measures to prevent the possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma cruci@@ ble was observed .
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally standardized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients , who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , remained in the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single dose , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal natural and are related to pharmac@@ ological action of the drug because the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known side effects identified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on tests on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects deri@@ ving from the lip@@ id properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is applied in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ ine residue of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ dependent diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first six months . &quot;
&quot; the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , no metabo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected in plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation . &quot;
&quot; two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified as a particular threat to humans . &quot;

learn more about the blue pages in section 6 for more information on how to define your calorie goals and fet@@ us boundaries .
&quot; if you have a meal or a meal no fat contains , do not intake a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking the capsule in connection with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to adjust your body to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule insertion with a calorie and fet@@ tre@@ du@@ ed diet . &quot;
&quot; dietary cloth@@ s are effective as you can understand at any time , what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to alter your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve your goal weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Provi@@ de gre@@ asy to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity .
&quot; • If you cannot determine any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of use of all@@ i , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , you must end the intake of all@@ i . • With a successful weight loss , it is not about switching the diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you listed may significantly imp@@ air you or notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods , and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial night@@ stand , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• Do not store medicines for children . • Do not use all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the cardboard . • Do not keep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that will serve to keep the capsules dry .

being over@@ weight has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; sustained weight loss , for example by improving diet and exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently . &quot;
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les which you can also find as indication on food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to a maximum per day .
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; the amount of calories you choose is from the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the effectiveness of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of nutritional accompanying symptoms . &quot;
34 . this reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously approximately 0.5 kg per week without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . &quot;
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and to adhere to it . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal with information on the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other inform@@ ational materials that can help you feed lime and fatty acids and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , to support weight loss , you can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine which can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic agent ) .
&quot; the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 out of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd to appro@@ ve the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on response , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is said to be used in the days after chemotherapy , neither for the prevention nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , ri@@ dec@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 mc@@ g. of observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with al@@ op@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups showed themselves ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for al@@ op@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g. of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life , 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously at Day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ ar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. prescribed Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; after IV administration , initial decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed proportional in the entire dose range between 0.@@ - 90 μ and / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after a single dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and about 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , are involved in the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous cle@@ us injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function disorder the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of action .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is very low . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of this approval for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the medicine approved as part of this decision . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report that was recommended to use Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C . &quot;
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eus should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; pharmac@@ eu@@ tics &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( prolonged ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue exhibits damage , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amino acid fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted , which induc@@ es this to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eus was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ . int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug being marketed may not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients responding to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eus and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after adjusting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was re@@ tar@@ ded in more patients than with the reference medicine ; Al@@ ph@@ eus also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ filtration ( cra@@ cking or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against these kinds of infections .
&quot; alt@@ ar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the treatment was completed .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin diseases , alt@@ ar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in case of skin wound , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( side @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by demonstr@@ ably or probably by MR@@ SA , it is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job place .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is to be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After oral dosing of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement on effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
the decision to continue / stop breast@@ feeding or continue the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefits of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for women .
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect Ir@@ rit@@ ation was the administration of approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50 sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
&quot; by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partially blocking P @-@ binding interactions and prevents normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appears question@@ able at least some infection forms , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on off skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and for the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP shirt . &quot;
&quot; the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive stroke and thy@@ roid disease . &quot;
in @-@ vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse lymp@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats evidence of reduced fertility for oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses may end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can defend itself against illness . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; since 1996 , Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the Twin@@ et Ad@@ ult M@@ acc@@ ine , which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , in the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan existing in three doses , Twin@@ et adults and Twin@@ et children are administered . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ et adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ et adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ eness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the vacc@@ ination plan for pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ Hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) , observed after pri@@ ming with the combination vaccine , are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not yet fully assured , if immun@@ o@@ competent persons who responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need to be vacc@@ inated as protection since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory for non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form in@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value may be achieved after pri@@ ming , so in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in the case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected from sub@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as in these cases it may come to bleeding after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal and preser@@ v@@ ative formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , Ambi@@ rix toler@@ ability was compared with the three @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ing on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.2 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was comparable high ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle with 3@@ 9,@@ 6 % of subjects who got Ambi@@ rix ) compared to 3@@ 6.2 % among the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was small and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form in@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix in the 3 @-@ dose vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both trials , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form in@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in persons who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mming between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form in@@ active H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus , and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time as a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ - and ser@@ oton@@ ous rates similar to earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is commonly transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as by bathing in poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a steady treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines , ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick / feeling sick ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease . &quot;
&quot; protection against other infections caused by the liver or causing symptoms similar to those in hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immune system or if you / your child under@@ goes / under@@ goes a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / her child are taking other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / her child has been vacc@@ inated or has been given / or that is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women is not given , unless it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known for placing the first permit for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP thought that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive . &quot;
&quot; however , as Ambi@@ rix was brought into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia ende@@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gas stom@@ a ( through the stomach into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; it can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was permitted under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because only limited information about this medicine was presented due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of the life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use if hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually with regard to protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient required for growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ to@@ sis deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the origin of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kidneys occurs , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal increase and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) appeared and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
an over@@ dose case occurred during a 5 @-@ month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose limiting ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intraven@@ ous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain two nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ ting excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of bi@@ oplas@@ tic but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the prog@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the condition with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns used to be almost always inf@@ lexi@@ ble and the disease even led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of ex@@ cre@@ ting nitrogen ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium thi@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and who were already treated prior to the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival , but even in these patients it came with time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after single release as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following the IV administration of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plas@@ ma@@ concentrations were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary metabolism or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma the following morning . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; following the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated no g@@ ob@@ har@@ genic effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( babies and children , who can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ a or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before birth , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ am@@ idal cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain two nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the secre@@ tion of excess
&quot; based on tests on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram the bi@@ oplas@@ tic but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical state may occur . &quot;
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking measured plas@@ ma@@ concentrations were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
&quot; during durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium thi@@ x@@ yl@@ ate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may go into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ b@@ ance , leave of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room to initiate a suitable treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; blood cell changes ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , stomach ache , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , uncomfortable skin smell , skin rash , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal lab results . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you listed may significantly imp@@ air you or notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date shown on the box and the container .
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; they should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to the same single doses or@@ ally or via a stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • Det@@ ach a spo@@ on@@ ful spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ules from the container . use a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stress up@@ lift &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measure of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if the angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and for a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ) attack inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure a dose of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial IV dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a sole Bol@@ us @-@ Gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the dose can quickly be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which one PCI is subjected to ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din versus ACS ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose can be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ validation @-@ din @-@ Bol@@ us with no dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
&quot; patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines are administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in the case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial punc@@ tu@@ ation occur , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , in principle bleeding can occur everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is again achieved pre @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te units ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines with plat@@ el@@ et aggregate units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ validation alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; in the Bi@@ validation @-@ group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood point , Re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ zations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation spots , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on adverse events are based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ us@@ ine group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to suffer from adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects which are not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped in table 6 according to system organ@@ classes .
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the ani@@ on bladder region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ ru@@ mb@@ ine is tied in the liquid phase or to cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ validation @-@ din on thro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in deri@@ ves slowly the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum of patients in which there was a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ born thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ born thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) had not indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ag@@ gregation reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients bi@@ vali@@ us@@ ine shows a dose @-@ and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion was increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or to process insulin effectively .
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in a study of 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin resistance . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal cavity , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal bags . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in changing the treatment pattern .
&quot; the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ cop@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phs , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of symp@@ a@@ thetic agents such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ dine , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and Reserv@@ ations , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weakened or lacking . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ lis@@ in and human@@ ities regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin occurs neither in breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are classified according to system organ@@ classes and classified according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is lined to continuously change the injection point inside the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated with in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by a doctor &apos;s intraven@@ ous administration . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ cos@@ a injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose lowering effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that at an application of insulin lu@@ lis@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ s are turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ aria , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
