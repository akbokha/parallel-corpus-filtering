<seg id="4">"it is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental disorder where the patients have episodes of normal mood alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems when oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for taking or treating the enamel tablets in patients who are experiencing difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are decomposed as well as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly known as "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter acts to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalising the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents its recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, preventing the occurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies spanning up to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased turmoil over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injections was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased turmoil, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in the patient's symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled tick), nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting (increased salivation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were based on the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were based on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased potency in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using Aripiprazole compared to other anti-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cardiac insufficiency), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, occasional reports of Dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aripitizol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia treated with Abilify, consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing to mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be cautiously applied in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with convulsions.</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyamic, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain generally is observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combi bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, and may lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study involving healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC by Aripiprazole by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripitizol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose-height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripivzol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethylan / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethylan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for human safety and the concerns originating in the reproduction studies in animal studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk of the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripitizol has no negative influence on it."</seg>

<seg id="70">"CPK increases (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy, and also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyspinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without fatalities."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripisizol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergen and to the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor-ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and the Putamen, showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor-ligands."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of responder patients, who held a response to study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse compared to 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% compared with the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripiprazole demonstrated a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a lasting effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripitizol showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial lasting more than 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproar monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole revealed an superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproar."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyness is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripitizol on extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours with 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripitizol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripitizol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripitizol and dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchycin loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report that was recommended to use Alpheon 6 million for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C."</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheus should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "pharmaceutics").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (prolonged) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns have been voiced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug being marketed may not be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responding to treatment with Alpheus and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after adjusting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retarded in more patients than with the reference medicine; Alpheus also had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infiltration (cracking or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the treatment was completed.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin diseases, altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in case of skin wound, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that in the treatment of abscesses (side-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by demonstrably or probably by MRSA, it is not effective enough."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job place.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of retinapamulin ointment, the treatment is to be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After oral dosing of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement on effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision to continue / stop breastfeeding or continue the treatment with Altargo is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied altargo, the most common reported side effect Irritation was the administration of approximately 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckeranus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50 sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, partially blocking P-binding interactions and prevents normal formation of active 50 ribosomal sub-units."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should, due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of Retapamulin appears questionable at least some infection forms, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2709">"the in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5)."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinet adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinet adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or to process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active duration than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in a study of 878 adults, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults in type 2 diabetes."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal cavity, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal bags."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-related diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in changing the treatment pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopyramide, fibrate, fluoroxetine, propoxyphs, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidine and Reservations, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or lacking."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humanities regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin-lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin occurs neither in breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral application."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"lipodystrophy is lined to continuously change the injection point inside the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by a doctor's intravenous administration."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucosa injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin-lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate increase in the glucose lowering effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is reached like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandiale control was achieved than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin-luliss are turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 rents before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
