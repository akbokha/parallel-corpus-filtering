&quot; if part of the text is selected , only this part is translated in place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore you should not make important decisions on the translations without checking the translation before .
&quot; only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish website , where you can insert translated texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot;
further information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting extensions .... Open the map card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard modules from the box node ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
the module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras bar filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; displays another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps indicates the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the dimensions of the sub @-@ objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily detected if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap is a rec@@ tangle which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful colour and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ tangle that is switched over View color mode can either be depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ tangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if sufficient space for representation is present or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les occur . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ tangle . &quot;
&quot; with display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be adher@@ ed to that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tangle is square . &quot;
&quot; how to split the area of an entry for the child entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through boxes to create rectang@@ les that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ rent branches . &quot;
&quot; you can design@@ ate the minimum represented area for an entry on the menu entry View stop area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ esi@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you access the image gallery module , a dialog opens , which allows you to set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
display the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image to indicate whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
display the file size of the image to indicate whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
display the image size check box to see if the size of images below the thumb@@ nails is displayed in the gallery .
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up with a slider or a turning field , to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
copy the original images to the gallery if you want to copy the original images to the gallery .
&quot; using the comment text box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box Custom color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be set here :
the Media Play@@ back for the Navigation Pan@@ e can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under window navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback . &quot;
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the default browser recognition of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that deny access with this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; changes the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages , which deny access to browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to access the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Use elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identi@@ fier of this outdated browser .
this option uses the default browser identi@@ fier for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ module you check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .
check the module website in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the menu under Extras web page . you can carry out the following tests :

&quot; a camera interface that is easy to use will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ .@@ More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ Photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ .@@ To@@ gether . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , dozens of professional capabilities are available . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by means of li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; if you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. in this mailing list however , you should be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get started &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instruction to login to the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply type the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam , you will also use as an al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ c@@ am set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ kam ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; recur@@ sively , recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders except it is in hidden folder . this allows you to add a point before the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using this on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up and digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My List templates to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu assistance menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section ro@@ h @-@ de@@ oder@@ settings and ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; a camera interface that is easy to use will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ .@@ More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ Photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ .@@ To@@ gether . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as disk drive . the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read by some lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the expression support is not available in lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy it can expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that you can &apos;t put an image in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the toolbar at the moment . so the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this ind symbol view is displayed . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , according to the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Im@@ por@@ tioning Images . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the picture with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and album features to give you information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections from the toolbar , you can do so in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
&quot; buttons El@@ dest , A@@ verage , New Year : these put the date on the oldest , newest picture or the average of the album . this first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; selected . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports input of keywords for single photos in the area My key@@ wor@@ d@@ list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait short while the preview images are generated . this allows you to avoid using the Extras All thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the preview window . which information this is , you can edit the Edit Settings . select the albums page and customize the preview images to suit your preferences . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest over a picture . the help displays the most important properties including all keywords in a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction into the main window displays such an auxiliary window .
&quot; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit ... . in the Edit page , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . &quot;
&quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you store the modified image . therefore , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot;
the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , delete it in the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; displaced . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My dates list ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam , uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; keywords are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or finding a search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list , so that you can find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or on an existing keyword and then selecting a new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and then drop it there . then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be only once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting a keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the key and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the images and select keywords from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have completed a photo with keywords , this will appear in the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the tags menu Rem@@ ove . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame , you only have to click on the lower rec@@ tangle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus , all related images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ ras@@ er search box is a small lamp that will be green if the search finds hits . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box like the one described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you only need to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit searches , the form will appear to enter the search again with the searched search information . if you choose to edit as an advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu . &quot;
advanced search gives you an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are displayed in line , separated by operators . an option can be added to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , N@@ one ... or at least ... &quot;
&quot; it allows images to compare by comparing these sign@@ atures . the smaller the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they are . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar items : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . if you slide a picture from anywhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ made sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right images . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or move out using the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this pres@@ upp@@ oses your pictures ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em light table from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview toolbar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly extract from a series of images . if you use pairs to navigate from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the area for comparison . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal deletion operations work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the lumin@@ ous table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photographs records , scans or stores digital photos carries a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images , find , protect , and use photos . here , we focus on the process for digital photographers who are &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; using . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , re@@ generating , rating , review , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Invent@@ ory takes on , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transform@@ ations , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that holds a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no stock management to find a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . the approach to store the metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats freely . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide if you want to have access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photographs , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option in the Edit page of the metadata in &amp; Edit ; to enable . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam , provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos when you do so . &quot;
&quot; let us now use keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert images in the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another .
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share your photos with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream of associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others to look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images . &quot;
do you remember the time before GPS ? when you had to go to another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with speed of light .
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips using pictures with geographical information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples of this can be the title : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who lives the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the picture is a bearing photo , then here is the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to popul@@ ate the author and copyright sections although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete these , embedded metadata in the picture . for private persons , this is very important to the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk failures , disk failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to combat the problem in CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious issues must be handled and you can no longer trust CDs and DVDs in archive quality that last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that is a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just written them . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to cause miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that this media can read . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ manufacturers retain their stat@@ s for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the mechanisms of failure of hard drives : Disk@@ etch Study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some errors fixed by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ pending failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices don &apos;t matter much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these can cause serious damage . therefore , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause damaged key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware age , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy j@@ okes and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , then make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide overhead lines for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to even continue working until the current is running . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security when it comes to electricity disrup@@ tions with the costs to avoid this . you can get a high quality over @-@ voltage protection by up to 50 % . this is only a small difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are refer@@ enced to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies included a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS file system and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing about it is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have to open a photo to your surprise . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling fil@@ es@@ ystems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stops of aperture from fundamental physical boundaries . meaning that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this boundary .
&quot; even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather wor@@ sens . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality look are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else responsible for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . &quot;
&quot; therefore disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : one of the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync copies only the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ TC data , associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ covering images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in order for valuable images to survive the next 40 year , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available to everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite easy : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source , the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the file if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if there is no more software available one day , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
&quot; TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , with some cameras you can store your images in this format . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed due to the need to uni@@ fy the camera ear formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available to help Canon and Nikon use it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block@@ quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata placement quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP does it because it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when you link between the metadata file and the image file , and as indicated above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of application and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include the work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera edit are , you can use it as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then you should add the metadata again . these were then cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the section adding a photo to an album you will be able to add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface will provide you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description for this can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not provide thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. will appear on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufacturer Not@@ ching , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. download the photos from their camera to a single album , before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all of the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then select Sel@@ ected . the selected button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed up to now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use the buttons All for download or download Sel@@ ected , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; load the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by using the Del@@ ete All . if you just want to delete some , you must select it first and then delete selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a digi@@ ti@@ zed ; -@@ album . if you want to delete the camera , you should do so about the camera system , since this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally recycled again after the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been taken into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; during the transfer , three more options will be opened before the photos will be stored on the disk . the first two will affect the data on the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y % D % H % H : % M : % S in the editing field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case when downloading . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic turn is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam , use this to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you know where to upload the images . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and click OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and card references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to store this data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with Phil Har@@ vey &apos;s Ex@@ if@@ Tool . it uses the characters hair@@ y coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you need to change . to access these settings , you need to set up in the Edit Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ y ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the respective IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should be a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered here as this is the picture of another &amp; quot ; aff@@ en@@ quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digi@@ ti@@ zed database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be entered and digi@@ ti@@ zed without going to be lost .
&quot; image descriptions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) saved in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ces ; to indicate , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ aire by &amp; digi@@ kam , can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings are turned on . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or light colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant to be enco@@ ded in higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
&quot; setting PNG compression allows you to reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the TIFF files option , you can comp@@ ress the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it does not affect image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less . &quot;
&quot; loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files can save you loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it evol@@ ves very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option marks the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard , it is based on a fixed color balance , which was photograph@@ ed in sunlight on a white card . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the top @-@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned in due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights as a penet@@ rating white . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the Edit &amp; Edit image options . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial ro@@ h@@ data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour reproduction .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w provides three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ dient correction , as it is done during the shell conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to do it again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ent ; information such as colour information from a color space to translate into the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ ders Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures color does not color the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , e.g. Canon , which do not have color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be given from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this can be corrected manually , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models from Canon . hence , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewing and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules supported to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be edited by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during display . &quot;
&quot; on the right side there is a button auto detection which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in low @-@ time mode . below you can find serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ y ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to the display mode and switch on . &quot;
&quot; check out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window &apos;s cameras . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the dialog by &amp; Edit ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in the del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
editorial changes using the right side@@ bar can be sil@@ ently filed by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you must save the changes with the button changes .
&quot; you can also see &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the &quot; &quot; Welcome screen &quot; &quot; screen ; this speeds up the start process of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; if something from the base folder has been deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you know if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the ad / Edit entries .
the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; therefore you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original picture before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . &quot;
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file saving .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore from the File menu or using the Rest@@ ore button restore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have performed on the photo since last saving . &quot;
virtually any action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by selecting Edit Ret@@ ur@@ ns or restoring by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the back or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change it in the Settings dialog by &amp; Edit ; edit the main window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select Print from the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de file ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture templates can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and choose from the menu album Ex@@ por@@ tioning print wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available , without the navigation arrows , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again into the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trunc@@ ated after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ hap@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after comm@@ enting it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the App@@ ly button there is a button More . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the comment section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ y session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword you entered . you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , they are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check@@ box in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the Key@@ word keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - date , keyword and search views is used . if additionally one or more keyword filter from the right side is used , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all generated keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can be switched off also by Settings Differ@@ ent .
&quot; if you have created a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an advanced search across all the elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why you use a color managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired outcome . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
&quot; your only other image editions are per email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and get thoughts about color management n@@ g ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB means that your monitor is c@@ alli@@ calibr@@ ated on s@@ RGB . if you work as in the colour space of s@@ RGB , you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve an image in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , Automatic balancing and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values across the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
&quot; similar : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; this method maximizes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area . &quot;
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ am@@ acoustic of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White Balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited since a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in the 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Color whit@@ esp@@ ace of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . if you want to see the original white color again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play the stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview in order to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed .. you will get the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Upload buttons make exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original .
&quot; here you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and only available for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar radiation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that arose when one partially developed a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the coloured , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted coloured film made by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ a@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can view the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous strength / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on sound correction for the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you will need only the range of the sli@@ ders for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and make sure the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light sounds and the lowest for the medium tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . for this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and Sonn@@ ent@@ öne . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator control adju@@ sts all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
&quot; next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is mostly the most useful . in this case , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short part to the right , i.e. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ en the associated image pixels . &quot;
&quot; if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the gi@@ mp format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator control adju@@ sts all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the digi@@ ti@@ zed &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to preserve L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colored noise first . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later and then load it . the used file format is the gi@@ mp @-@ channel bl@@ ender format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator control adju@@ sts all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) can be seen .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ er filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ece . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
to keep the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you enter the desired type of frame for your image . the image is circum@@ fer@@ mented with a colored line , ni@@ eper circum@@ fer@@ ns it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Tem@@ plate App@@ ly you can place a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu apply in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations on size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to dimin@@ ish the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil to the digi@@ ti@@ zed file size , simply send an email in English to the digi@@ ti@@ y ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder in dialog with the base folder button . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder appears . the selection of a folder automatically refres@@ hes the preview of the templates . &quot;
below the preview you find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . add the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image shar@@ per . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather psych@@ edel@@ ic . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined into a common color . this in turn results in sharp edges a little blur@@ red . S@@ LR cameras normally need more after sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; with JPEG images , a camera is often used internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format on the other hand must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable them , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this can be used with the menu entry for Cor@@ rec@@ ting Field . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique is to focus on correc@@ ting the tool . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter blur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first be tried out . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will generate near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
the amount between the original and the blur@@ red image will be added to the original . this will make the strength of the sharp@@ ness set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty f@@ laws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example for the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the digi@@ ti@@ zed tool re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colours in image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which also depends on the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the mark@@ up effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . &quot;
&quot; use this parameter to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the G@@ auss . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that there are lots of operations that are not immediately visible , but which later leave nasty art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , blur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . even under optimal conditions the result of the F@@ IR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this image has been done with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the focus correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the slider smooth@@ ens the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available def@@ aults are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the picture . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es uni@@ form@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ dient or CCD noise , a high value of wave @-@ like patterns will be generated . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ akte are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , one or two is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; angular focal length da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , it should also be selected small . therefore , make sure that small angles make a long runtime . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the increase in quality you receive by choosing this option is only low . however , it doubles the running time . therefore , we recommend that you leave it out . &quot;
the Save as and Upload buttons make this exactly . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photograph that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides selectable images filter to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window will stay with the default settings .
&quot; the radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time needed for the filter per pixel and can blur@@ b the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller errors corrected . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong you cannot remove the entire noise or to remove noise peaks . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak his@@ sing or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the image settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas which are typically smo@@ other .
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the exc@@ itation that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharp@@ ness . use tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gra@@ dation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting . the texture replacement is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for the restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ akte reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , even very far away . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
photo @-@ Rest@@ oration is comparatively very fast at work . it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ dient on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) to see .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph that was scanned with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel &amp; quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark thumb@@ nail . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you take the dark image directly to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark@@ er to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard loc@@ ates the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the corrupt pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are used to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ tization ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ectable quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise blur@@ red effects are caused by motion . &quot;
it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an a@@ qui@@ val@@ ente transformation on a raw screen made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions turns the transformation with a center filter onto a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three controls you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 2 , or random@@ ly to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controller only provides positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a better read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient fourth gra@@ dient correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two can almost eliminate any geometric distortion .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , c@@ lay@@ ered distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values are ver@@ tig@@ inous distortion . &quot;
this value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Parameter &apos; has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree .
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the tone or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or res@@ izing . the best way is to perform this correction as the first one . if you want to re @-@ cut an image and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal aid line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black verti@@ ces . you can remove them using the cutting tool from the Edit menu or via the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website , which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Add film gran@@ ul@@ ing option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; this is known by classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of films , manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ ined vision specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film grade effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ zed , filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect . &quot;
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better for large images . smooth@@ es the smooth@@ ing or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch around you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter Gra@@ ve shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filter en@@ grav@@ ings are a quick tool to re @-@ give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects take long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Zoom : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in the field of sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing from a car or train . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
vibr@@ ating blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by random shift of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects take a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Be@@ enden button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool for making ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . it gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images .
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirr@@ oring or turning into the correct orientation . &quot;
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you re @-@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Trans@@ form size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; change the size of the tool using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo blown was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintain the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
the Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any single @-@ click for a photo can be saved as text file and later loaded again .
&quot; infl@@ ating a photo is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Be@@ enden button . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rec@@ tangle . you will then see this rec@@ tangle as you move the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging the corners of the rec@@ tangle . create a new rec@@ tangle by using the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ trl @-@ button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; cutting tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog two buttons have to be centered horizontally or vertically .
&quot; below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when using the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the sett@@ ling aid settings allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tangle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diagonal . &quot;
&quot; golden centre : the golden centre is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides more fluid lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third angel the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
&quot; another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to draw the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral of the above . their verti@@ ces are the middle @-@ points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that , in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal angles . diagonal to these lines can be released a static object more dynam@@ ischer . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise . &quot;
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al and Ver@@ tical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the color button , you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ ti@@ zed image editing and tool free rotation . &quot;
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right .
&quot; to your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can position it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the Transform@@ ers function from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is a little spar@@ ed . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming knife cutting from image processing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal loop , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rec@@ tangle will be turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve done the sc@@ aling , the picture will get a bit blur@@ red . for a single layer this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two lay@@ ings produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has some tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate these is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing .
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that you know . this is done by means of file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change the file extension . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also store loss@@ less when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw screen format , you can read it under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw @-@ format images in JPEG or TIFF with the Ra@@ w image converter . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is written in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in .
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understands these formats and therefore does not have built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit films .

&quot; if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; use a uniform dialog box showing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applic@@ ation@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical divide without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview pane .
&quot; horizontally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original , and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane . &quot;
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; the upper part shows the original and the lower , for comparison , the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties tab displays the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or move out using the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this pres@@ upp@@ oses your pictures ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the Di@@ alogue palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the Pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the tick box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is checked under the color button color , the color from the color table is inserted at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box over@@ writing under the cursor cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character if another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then select them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs ; programs that are &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; calcul@@ ates the graph and is in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to represent more than this node )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; required for the representation of graphs .
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphs ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar only contains the icon file and the ( empty ) list of opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or several &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file was changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later it will be as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphical ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; instance or want to display the graphs in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but change it with the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come on one page , are to be fitted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
side preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without head line and with a different font
&quot; you can set default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) , or repeat the program every time . &quot;
the Open@@ ing page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graphs in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose from different &amp; graphical / layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graph@@ ene . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; the algorithm is the standard for descrip@@ tive graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm generates a spring @-@ spring model for un@@ coated graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multiple trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes in a circular way according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph@@ ene file as parameters , and output the calculated layout of the graph according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . using such a layout command , you can change the graphs using a filter , or change the graphs using a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
defines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ eri@@ enced ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed and ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ er@@ ect graphs ) .
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI element with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help to this element ( if any ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module can be used to read images to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do so you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; if you are able to open the menu entry pictures , a dialog appears which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the Scan button , wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image by saving the image . &quot;
screen@@ shots you can create after you have selected in the Import menu &gt; screen shot ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when All your program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have checked the entire work surface , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the above mentioned options . &quot;

&quot; if you choose the change option the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ co@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the location can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic Location Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . to load a possible correlation over time and location , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation carried out which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera &apos;s time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera status . if the deviation is included below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for images , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ relations button to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a series of photos at the same place . since the dialog changes from one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge it . you can select this again and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Image Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded in UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you do not need to select these albums by clicking on the three buttons on the right .
&quot; the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be created in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the messages to determine if errors have occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short@@ cuts and cra@@ fting . it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture will be displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing , as no compression of the color information takes place . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Client module is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ co@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please check out exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module is a tool for converting a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for Sli@@ deshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . &quot;
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . then you can start using Tools MPEG slide show to start the module .
the images you select are then listed under picture files in the portfolio . you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can use the encoding button to start the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings button on the right . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo formats . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w !
first select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to process your images frequently or later use it elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion progres@@ ses . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Star@@ code and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio stays unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
non @-@ por@@ tional : not proportional size variation in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program .
&quot; after you start the module , the picture window will be shown with the images you selected . you can add more pictures using the Add Photos button . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the image list and put them there to add you to the list of images to be sent .
with the Del@@ ete button the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can click the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject .
make sure you don &apos;t send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the pictures in a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend you to JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
after starting the module Advanced slide show a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the option File Name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the left lower corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can cancel it manually using Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds equals 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance is however from your computer and the selected transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select from each transition between the images a different effect .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date now does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ co@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Back@@ stage is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with notes , you can interact with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries are present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser will change . see picture . &quot;
this selection method allows you to limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few single images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . they can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save their own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately ( if you do not have any suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must choose which image to display for each individual . to do this , you need to open the image @-@ view window ( described in closer ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor to your preferences and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the search function in the main window , a dialog is displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can also be a part of the total file , for example in 1971 , or the full date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images by specific names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try similar functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ ap album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the Photo@@ Album from the menu Help menu . then some sample images will be loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you the date statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when navig@@ ating in the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a bar in the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create html pages with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as a module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas : content , Layout and Obj@@ ectives . in the following , each area is described in more detail . &quot;
first enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
&quot; finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without description . for example , all images are exported from a party . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . as a result , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so , he can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a larger image , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
in this setting you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be stored . this folder is saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . to enable the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File menu or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ in file folder . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for exporting images is described , which you can access via the File Ex@@ porting ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ in files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when you option manually copy the images to the .@@ k@@ in file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
with the Automati@@ cally Copy the .@@ k@@ in file copy &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ in files are normal zip files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option on this page is limited to maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ in from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... then &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
&quot; first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder you want to import images . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database persons . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories it will match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting information about your images , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and will be used automatically for future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , you can use the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; through the menu entry , Set@@ ting Photo@@ album ; setting up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will see the different settings . &quot;
&quot; on the left you will see six different icons , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also define your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each picture . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog box used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left pane of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but are distributed separately . however , most modules have a help page which you can call via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared by several applications each other , it can be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : there is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order of albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ ap album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that you see the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category presents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Per@@ sons , you will do so , so if you select people to view and share it with the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu bar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to comment on each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the image , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . &quot;
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; you can see three lists with a text field by setting up persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and displayed on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , so that the used names are moved upwards , the persons can find and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphab@@ etically sorted list , click on the sort by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and note them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Not@@ ation Di@@ alogue it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag and drop an entry in a category to make it an sub @-@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame , by dra@@ gging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then show / hide the window . this is shown in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select Show pictures in the browser , you get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it is displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the images you want to delete and press the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images , without having you saved on the hard drive . of course , you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is trunc@@ ated are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can not view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them again . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance of how to avoid confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end those remaining that you may want to see for others and click to lock the menu entry All out of the current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which images should be hidden in case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures to hide . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply choose password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to rep@@ el the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; over a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered in the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag and drop it with the mouse . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer you can enter the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can easily draw a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . the minus key zo@@ oms in in the middle of the picture . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equivalent button the zoom is set , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out are the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the turn functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you view images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment , you can see this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look at one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to provide images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letters . in view , you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can display categories in the In@@ dre preview window , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the characters for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later . &quot;
&quot; in order to save the painting mode of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , select On the image color from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work , you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; be sure to read and understand . &quot;
in the object @-@ tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ up menu is displayed to enable you to select the correct position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed attributes , click App@@ ly to take over these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or reject the changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; click on preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross it locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has a feasibility stage as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their exposure stage is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several window orders and switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the slider to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle will then show the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the p@@ ater in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tab cards at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the attack on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the summary bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the summary bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... Store . a dialog will appear where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene you can render them render . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select Show Sc@@ ene tab . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the inter@@ sections section and enter the image section to render into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality , you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . for a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties , please refer to the user manual for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally see pictures with this property better .
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and links &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling takes the neighbouring pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always split up and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce noise for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can specify whether the alpha channel should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the respective beams did not hit the object . &quot;
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished you can find the reason for this here .
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select File Import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full scope of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . locate the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , al@@ timeter data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene file , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the view field in the camera view and in the windows type plates .
&quot; you can adjust the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses advanced projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you display a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick to activate edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more details about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window configurations , or create new window configurations . in the window pane , you can see how to create and save window configurations . &quot;
the standard window arrangement option : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and Del@@ ete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating in the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed everything without errors see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu Rem@@ ove . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points that you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; when you press the App@@ ly button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a box ( insert end body quot@@ a ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the Enter key . the new name is immediately displayed in the object tree . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also displays the layer , albeit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but in the moment select something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub@@ property . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button you can see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material because you can still check the pig@@ ments settings . therefore always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time by clicking on Pre@@ view . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the ader and ball in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then go to the Pre@@ view button . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , these are not the colors you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Ein@@ colored . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one color and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
you should be able to do this step as you have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should already understand it . the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step , set a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ property and change the name , for example , in the Pig@@ ment Ball . click the Pig@@ ment Ball , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the gloss effect and reflection results in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even when metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good idea of what possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera which ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender comp@@ utes the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effects . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and will replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ one command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can modify or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bending on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying a picture file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the Return key .
you can adjust if each image is to be displayed in your own window or whether all images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if an appropriate fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Setup - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash cards . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can set the working mode of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this item is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still viewing the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves the name of the last opened folder . next boot opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window mode is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up only some of the file types that the program can display .
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; set the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reporting problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photograph , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photograph . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; there are many options that change the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photograph . to access these settings , you need to change the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photo ; in order to access these settings , you need to change the settings dialog in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicator , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to view . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image to save or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview display in the settings selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will return to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview should be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it will be automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by button ... &quot;
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images that are automatically stored and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is recorded each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the over starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the Settings button shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other keyboard short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and choosing short commands ... Select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; Amar@@ ok additionally has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialogue , so that the user know why a script does not run . &quot;
beginning require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is for this script . &apos; k@@ dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is picked up . the script could well ask for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume controls a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected playlist files if a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; terminated , or when the user stops a script , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed in order to Z. B. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be configured with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
&quot; the main script needs to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is finished , you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attach . for your record on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also find just a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collections web browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult for you , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to type in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report these to the mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has multiple flash cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is disabled , only the playlist window is displayed ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . thus the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer is changed .
&quot; note : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ able . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ able / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; to save playlist on completion , the current playlist will automatically save when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , causing the playlist window to open / un@@ roll to keep the running piece in the visible window area . &quot;
changing the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; selecting fonts for the following area will be selected . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can design@@ ate your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated below for foreground and background color . &quot;
resume playback when starting to resume &amp; Amar@@ ok ; resume playback automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last exit .
&quot; setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is cli@@ cked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the shadow field shadow causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . clicking on the color palette opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by inser@@ ting plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , which allows you to set the O@@ SD on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment . &quot;
the card file audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more settings in this tab card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
Browse the sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to search for music both as well as their sub@@ folders .
&quot; monitor changes : enable &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to supervis@@ e the selected folders for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : add that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the playlist browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation field driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using calcul@@ ator , the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under Port : the network port is entered , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the load .@@ f@@ m card file provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can see the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have c@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager considers the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . gn@@ omes will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will support difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will get an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file and create the file again . &quot;
usually this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... into the setting of the sound system , or at least do not use any value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / Re@@ play / Dynamic Play@@ list ) always look actively in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . you can sometimes click on a symbol in the control centre under Ap@@ pear@@ ance symbols . note that in some cases you must click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ca app : icon look@@ up error : cat@@ ech@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
you can also help other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one error , if you find something on the fixing of an error in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do you get music there ? &quot;
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column to show . you can also use the short@@ cut commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it there exactly as you would like to do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the playlist will be saved . click on it . &quot;
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be supported Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the default no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously generate audio . this can be achieved through a sound card using hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . &quot;
the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . you may need to specify another sink for G@@ Stre@@ amer ( e.g. shock sink ) .
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound Server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia entirely to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less por@@ e react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . carry out a record registry to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok in advance ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder and run it again in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good .
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run this command with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you are wo@@ ken by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks when you &apos;re on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ us@@ ern@@ ames Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace the IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers should be displayed .
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD , then click on audio CD from the menu . you can open a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escaped string ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; this is basically the previous evaluation with a decreasing value , based on how often the play was played . the more the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece exactly the same as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece using the right mouse button . you can also modify the evaluation in the Edit dialog . &quot;
developers do not want you to pret@@ end when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings tool lists ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Visual context @-@ browser design , click on New Design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ ors Navigation Pan@@ e allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
if you want to use AL@@ SA then please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also a lot of fault reports .
presumably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you have to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I receive an error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ h is installed .
&quot; in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module also has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ h . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; set up Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output set the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine configuration dialog , and output is done on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of conversion of sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box in the sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed car@@ egi@@ ver for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , this Quick Start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; create a playlist is very simple . drag entries from the collections web browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for specific pieces . if you are content with the playlist , you can save it by using the button playlist to save it . you can find this button in the playlist of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , then you are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD from the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio CD protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the Burn menu . you have here different ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any regular multimedia player , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current play time , bit rate and sample rate of the current play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the runtime display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press it on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located under the runtime display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button for setting equ@@ ali@@ zers is used .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the play buttons , the volume control and the play position sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s play@@ lists ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that are not available in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context @-@ browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece to each different aspect . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the bottom window will be gone . the information presented there are now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performers and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section of this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . the title is the name of the piece , the artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the play in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you can see how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images can have any name , but images with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also show cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you see the contents of the album . &quot;
you can click on all items in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which one should be started . &quot;
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter - only group the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter / album - first the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track @-@ albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list amongst different performers . &quot;
&quot; group interpreter / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphab@@ etically by one another . the interpreter is ignored .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are first displayed by genre , among them by the artist . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is also sorted according to album below the artist . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing as you like . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the toolbar there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view . note how to use this filter in the manual section of this manual .
&quot; under the search filter there is a drop down box that allows you to filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This displays the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid sequence to play .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set the pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be stored .
&quot; for more details , see the section about the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - Due to this , the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different performers . &quot;
&quot; the album will then no longer be displayed among different performers , but again below the associated interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , for example . when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreter sorted in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , you finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar where you can get music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult due to simple dropping . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert abandoned files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired position . as soon as you enter letters , just press the pieces containing the letters . in order to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; when you enter separate search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one , two , the search will find all entries containing one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched by entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment bad .
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ clicking in the desired order . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side , you can find the Add button to add pieces to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the center of the toolbar there is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted to the Analy@@ zer by clicking the right mouse button . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is the menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window via the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many other buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on menu and setting up toolbar buttons . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by choosing actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear in the playlist : 1 will be played first , 2 second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these are later ) . &quot;
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly called Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right click on you and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Emp@@ f@@ ohl@@ ene plays with an empty playlist , and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled . &quot;
the New button will popul@@ ate the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit play@@ lists opens a dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
&quot; right clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
enter any name for the playlist here . however the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under observ@@ ance of the settings played . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece is played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , you will add random pieces from each of the playlist . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts install by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins will be used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , remember that you will receive a bad quality when you re @-@ code MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a loss@@ less format . &quot;
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog box that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned . &quot;

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; : burns all sorts of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions , which also offers &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are commonly referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and is in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can play differently lou@@ dly . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save as is shown with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you were running for each project file saving .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then also inter@@ rupt the project between saving and modifications . you can also cancel the project and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , what should be done with it , just as if you called for each project file close . &quot;
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project is asked what to do with it as if you had called file C@@ lose .
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you merge the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described via the What is this ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
&quot; this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create one copy of a CD which you would like to burn at some point later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video c@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; this also allows you to copy DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD that will burn you later . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , allowing you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the firing button . ( nerve * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the firing button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the video , encoding settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the toolbar currently appears in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line is a narrow range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to modify the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . thus , the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs can be set . for this , system administrators will need privileges , so you must enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . both programs are identical in the range of functions , therefore it is more important to your taste and the type of your task , which of the contribut@@ ors will give you the preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following to the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ ri@@ ve ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then receive a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
&quot; K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) : &quot;
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD , read for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on encoder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the U@@ I of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many encoding enco@@ ders enco@@ ded by default ( these enco@@ ders have to be added from the Linux distribution ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on your computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into MP3 or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , it must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ Pre@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setup only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of a request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - when a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Configuration dialog - encoding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default . it must be noted that before the encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already expi@@ red file will be selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and encoding . &quot;
&quot; opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main input dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for setting En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other like &quot; shor@@ ten &quot; or &quot; monkey &quot; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless included free with most distri@@ butions but there are open license questions &quot;
+ High to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but slightly deeper quality compared to O@@ GG with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a song . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and self @-@ ster@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or retri@@ eved by the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the encoder explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords when encoding MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t by l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which persons can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is written : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation : that means the author ) am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b you can use another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only be the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . when &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval from &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; or alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output program is used to store songs from the &amp; CD ; to save them to WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the right distribution first if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected wa@@ v files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the co@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read pi@@ ke on it and ob both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; read out . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 cut@@ ters ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , using a search engine because it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to it ( eg ; trying to copy something into it using the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably only done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD , what needs to be repeated for each and every CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them when you read a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device desig@@ nations for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; please select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when data is missing to generate keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
the cardboard card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet in order to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; it is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two drop @-@ down fields must be selected , at least the first . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls en@@ code the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box . &quot;
just take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , so simply try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; throw it out at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything in the same way as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded simultaneously : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core , or even a multi @-@ processor machine , it can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; running on the hard drive . we will create and set up MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is established as we want to get comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process described in this section must be repeated for each issuing &amp; CD ; repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data fet@@ ched by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore you will learn to enter the data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD now needs to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , look in the FAQ and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD has been successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t selected the check box for the automatic query by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; News Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; News Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words begin with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desired remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the created files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help for Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure that all pieces are selected or press the All Pi@@ eces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
&quot; if you click on the button selection out of the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you see this error message if you try to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that were not successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . this allows you to read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in the case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . if you are reading this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
this section is directed to persons who compile from source files and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be customized to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still to read ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program without any indication of how it will continue from this sort of empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or modify something useful , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you succeeded in obtaining the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time up@@ lifting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop to drag and drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to drag to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the method used .
&quot; session support . if you exit &amp; k@@ de ; quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialogue , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the Play from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played together . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth using the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo and change the playback speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the play menu stops the play . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have any lyrics at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song , so that you don &apos;t need to manually adjust the event . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , choose from the Settings menu the entries of text events or song events . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section , you will find how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize . click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set each one in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you exit the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . again , the file dialogue will appear , with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when Automati@@ cally adding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next Song button , next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the Previous piece button , previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map converts General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and therefore always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required conversion for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; An@@ other Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section specifies how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to play on tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch @-@ 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , similar to a gun shot . to do this , please enter the following into the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where every note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum ( like some key@@ boards own it ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; Key@@ maps are used above all to map out sounds on the percussion channel . for example , take a look at the provided key maps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to change the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be defined with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to play a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see which sounds are played on these key@@ boards .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button will no longer be green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played notes . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the Channel View menu : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; accept , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . &quot;
&quot; first , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , I have to change only to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Malaga . at the moment I am studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I try to take some time . as a hobby , I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ k @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me because I may have the file already . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and nobody gets money for it . I want to emphasize that I only want to program it further because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter problems , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to store preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarchy . if you receive an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Players / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . for this , simply click on a name of a category to view it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you must select the playlist from the File menu and select either the Edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when editing mode or selecting another group without comparing the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end animation , so the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body ; &amp; lt ; / Body gt ; &amp; lt ; / Body gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; /
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things .
&quot; another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Players . here , the output of m@@ player can be seen . &quot;
there is no rider for this playback in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Flash &quot; &quot; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE will be given . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the Back@@ end Edition is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , manually modi@@ fying the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c file must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , a phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this takes k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device and the TV channels . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog can be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be known ports from which one is selected . the code to use must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux upgrade for the X server must be functional . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; internally , S@@ MB uses different names for the sources . at the time of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
are there any hints on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be executed as user root after installing the device . it is important to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom drives the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for its performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ;
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be rever@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; - website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact about the box should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le , or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ ath ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy to use wizard , the &amp; latex , reference and powerful project management need to be called . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to experience the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
is the right pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a lay@@ ered ( lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it is derived from the last name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; here only a good view to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . in order to be properly controll@@ able , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction , with which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ starting { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ step wizard by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ art &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best should be used UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ) .
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex and latex , for inclusion only in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; with automatic completion of the environments , entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates an empty line ( for typing the text ) and the corresponding line to unlock the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the document to be sub@@ divided into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex files , retri@@ eval search can be very helpful . once a DVI file is created ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; , jump &amp; box ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the appropriate row in &amp; latex ; -@@ source . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the original output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the search search , elements of the DVI ; file are plu@@ cked with the editor and as soon as an element has been cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file is the exact opposite of it . once cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; latex ; source text is cli@@ cked at the appropriate point in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document working with others integrates .@@ tex files . a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings when using a project .
quick mounting : the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file is called &quot; &quot; native &quot; &quot; to Ã ¼ t@@ Ã ¼ t@@ â , and there is no call from &amp; oc@@ ular ; after quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when looking at the Edi@@ ting toolbar , the three large selection fields should be found . the selection fields have been developed for the quick fit of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick classification of the document in parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the Other is available for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified designation ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
&quot; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; box , by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop down sel@@ ector with the name &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e &quot; &quot; is used for defining the fonts . you can set the fonts for the main text , the notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . the document can be written down by hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the fonts . if the let@@ tering is not set at the beginning , it can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex will need to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the click of a button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; the storage will automatically exp@@ ire .
&quot; if you fail to compile the document , you should search for errors in logging . if you are using quick @-@ release , you should automatically start logging . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( enclosed environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few acid will have another type of environment . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } is then possible to change the size of the characters in the environment â &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ling &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the changes are only supervised within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold printing , ital@@ ics , under@@ scores , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics pressure and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be ital@@ ital@@ ised with \ \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; latex , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box ; . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . for this , min@@ d. a quote , a few passages in bold and itali@@ c expression and a poem should be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . &quot;
once the DVI ; file has been created the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
&quot; DVI ; is a stable file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex , the conversion can begin converted to other formats using the buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
the pre@@ text search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; latex files .
&quot; to execute the pre@@ text search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on preview . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then executed . &quot;
with this function in &amp; O@@ cular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document of &amp; box ; open and jump to the appropriate line .
&quot; should an error occur when using quick @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , it is displayed in the log listing file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log listing file registers the source code in the source text . in the editor , the knob predic@@ tor La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between the errors . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when choosing an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document can be used . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; c@@ ages users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and select file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Set@@ ting up Settings &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated input of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can choose your own template instead of default . &quot;
a template can be made of any &amp; latex ; files created . will be searched for a simple way to create a template should be searched for a template in the internet and the steps described under described steps should be searched .
&amp; box ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for programmers can be made directly from &amp; box ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its options , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can directly start reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides very convenient &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called over the help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex , and its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way when you click \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex covers ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can enter additional jumping marks . these are an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entry marks or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump mark is highlighted so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a mark . &quot;
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities are added in &amp; box ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; important functions for selecting a &amp; latex ; special commands for selection .
&quot; this extended meaning applies to tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; box , is that the trays are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also includes &amp; latex ; commands with a menu item ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to delete a part of the document , of course it can be balanced first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . by removing the following commands to delete the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edi@@ ting Environment for a possible easy work with &amp; latex ; . &quot;
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command you jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to leave the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands quickly the overview can be lost . this command includes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment will not be destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edi@@ ting Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket . &quot;
with this command you jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing clamp .
if the cursor is located in front or behind the shiel@@ ded clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted cur@@ ly cur@@ ly braces can be lost quickly to overview . this command includes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be dis@@ rupted . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple suits are used as a seal . for the purpose @-@ beneficial implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; is used for two simple quotation marks . also for the end of the application , the sign &quot; &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and provides two complete suits for latex ; one . &quot;
this automatic insertion of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; you can also use specific settings ( e.g. german or French ) , and thus German or French candidates . many other languages can also be used . &quot;
&quot; when pressing Shift ; Enter key for an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break , but at the same time the \ \ item command . &quot;
inside a table environment t &amp; box complete ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not the corresponding , add a few gaps for the column position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code completion offers , this was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; in order to include special commands ( mostly for latex ; ) . all these modes can be configured for different modes of operation under Settings . all these modes can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning a new environment is added by the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; box , automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , understand@@ ably , this is the completion list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jumping marks can be added , so that an easy jump to these positions by editing the jump mark N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est jump mark is possible and the changed parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; you can perform various lists of lists for tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands , as well as trays of the general language use can be selected . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not necessary for completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin and the inv@@ ocation mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the completion mode , the surrounding environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically added and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; box ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; you can perform settings on these lists . this mode uses the list of completion modes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box ... As an example of a drop @-@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is started over the menu or the C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large gray holes are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many people are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written documents . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu &quot; &quot; Settings ... &quot; . &quot; here , the threshold value can also be specified for displaying the completion . &quot;
&quot; the support files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / box / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics form the input of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all the construction tools are grouped in groups in the production comp@@ iling , converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer such as &amp; O@@ cular ; or the further conversion can be used by key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer by Alt ; 3 , by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file is viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Building Command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time . &quot;
&quot; a new project will be asked about the project &quot; &quot; New Project &quot; . &quot; here you will find the following information for the project : &quot;
&quot; when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ n project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&quot; &amp; latex ; is a fairly sophisticated system , where the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different aids to support the user . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and one additional &amp; latex ; -@@ Reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete manual for finding a specific format@@ ting . as it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; box ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible assistance , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; boxes ; delivered documents and there@@ for a graphical surface area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners . by &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ered and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source text editor , which can be used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ ath ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS X installed . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the progress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use by respecting the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; &amp; K@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sign@@ atures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface , you create random sign@@ atures or daily sign@@ atures from a list . this command line interface provides sign@@ atures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random sign@@ atures , any signature from the signature file is written by &amp; k@@ sig ; by many sign@@ atures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sign@@ atures the same signature from the signature file is from &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day , use different sign@@ atures , as with the random sign@@ atures , you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . if you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click the disk icon . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sign@@ atures as you like . then you have a list of sign@@ atures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sign@@ atures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the right and enter the new short command by pressing the key or key combination . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ b ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach sign@@ atures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all call st@@ ack@@ able elements are listed here . the older the stack entry , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in quick , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everybody who has worked with the &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ de &quot; &quot; documentation knows well @-@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; just cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book file in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the selected work folder , then leave the current working folder checked . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted each time suppos@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the recently opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , select the current work folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file in current file and select the file to scan by means of a different file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of &amp; DT@@ D ; specify the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already marked , then simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the file name as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; lay , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone uses the art@@ ef@@ it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears to be bold after which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . addressing may be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes can be entered . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comments text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the set nick@@ name of the team member , roll a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader and sub@@ project leaders should be given the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names , as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive regardless of upper or lower case but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that supports DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends across some pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including auto @-@ completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
cap@@ itali@@ zation of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : big / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files .
&quot; optional Tags Automati@@ cally C@@ lose : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above , for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; automatically update the start and end date : when enabled , the corresponding tag is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic sub@@ set of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters to the corresponding encoding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for the detection of different types of files . the default def@@ aults can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regularly creates backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come across by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section is used to control the control of the possibility to switch the warning messages by hooks out of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the Par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the structure tree settings the visibility of nodes in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree during editing and how deep when changing the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty nodes are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause signi@@ fies something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ VS @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load the component in the &quot; &quot; read @-@ only mode &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied charging . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts usually den@@ ies the load if this option is not selected . &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment but it should be installed later .
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ designed . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been dis@@ continued , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented which allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently only one plug @-@ in is available , which adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plu@@ gins in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection field the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
&quot; a view in which all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger is shown . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will make the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ Requ@@ ires . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that the normal case does not need to be taken care of . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
&quot; when this happens while the script is stopped , execution continues . if this happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without providing information about controlled variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if it happens before a debit request is given , the execution begins when a request is made . &quot;
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , with errors when possible in functions and inclu@@ sions . &quot;
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and proceed to the next as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; its simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag XML files with the suff@@ ix .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . file contains the rules and information of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool lists allow a fast inser@@ ting of tags into a document without the risk of a write error . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but element type about itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; if yes , the tag has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a merely element type element .
&quot; this element can only be used once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
returns the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can happen only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces should influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files is the Tools dialog at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start and check tag Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ charging function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; void &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor that can be edited by DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; with the following entries :
&quot; &#91; General &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can be set with Settings ... button . click New Action to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut added to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ sq@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way &amp; qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we have replaced the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file : / removed from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : replaced by PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if only one instance runs , the text is inserted unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above listed methods , a script can input input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default input , you can specify what is to be sent to the default input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to be done with the text written to the standard output , by setting the input field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the suitable toolbar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use its use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available to enable input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; in view that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green it is usually called loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least sign@@ alize a message to the user that clicking this icon will paste ; start@@ les ; tag in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it still has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are still which ones , or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool bar to set dialog over Settings toolbar . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick access to the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; save to the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that your toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you must create the doc@@ r@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index element = your description for these documentation for example &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see the documentation in PHP and PHP . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which serves to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation is displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of text elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / do@@ c for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at various points there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . we recommend that the contributions are checked and only available when our team is looking for a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your personal G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and by clicking OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool lists toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems it warns and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in tag@@ XML format . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D File menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defini@@ tive line : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type day such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; adapted . it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool lists with special promotions specially designed for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the cart@@ on guides with information and the tool@@ bars . please refer to , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card tra@@ j@@ ders , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor area to another context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing the tags located under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; using tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert data for this just tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ sions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate and browse in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for files , projects , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views are available . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool providing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the relevant user and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands is opened in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder do@@ c to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there is ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the P@@ AT@@ H before your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developer of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why Develop@@ ing what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase almost any task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way affiliated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or run k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . look in the Tem@@ plates section . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , converted special characters to &amp; HTML ; sp@@ elling so that it is displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script sends error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
starting and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project managers / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be added by means of Settings ... or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar .
&quot; removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team so that the toolbar will be available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
&quot; allows the upload of toolbar to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load one &amp; DT@@ D ; which made you or anyone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder doesn &apos;t exist fails the load fails .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu of the Tags / Ac@@ tions list on this toolbar in the Tags menu . &quot;
&quot; this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using a toolbar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plugin menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; select the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; ti@@ dy external application .
&quot; Instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card @-@ map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . selecting a entry will activate the appropriate sub@@ window . &quot;
allows to display the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web browser . &quot;
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or which can be added and the sequences can change .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since e.g. after filling the project name the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ bo@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you have the server address of the machine you want to access , except you process local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in case of ser@@ vers@@ al scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started anew from scratch , not hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection of good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the check@@ box , cl@@ inging from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new Project wizard will contain three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or changed using the Shift key Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by clicking its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify , or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . currently , you cannot influence this behavior . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar . the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ y as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... in the context menu called with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and will be forgotten by the user . this option is useful , if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk storage option is not eligible . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened , opened or deleted from the Project Parts menu in the Project or Project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best st@@ ack@@ able over the Tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding toolbar is treated below in the section Ad@@ ding tool lists .
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new toolbar can be removed , the toolbar can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where to specify which actions on this or other toolbar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will additionally remove action and edited action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and set Settings ... Set@@ ting actions .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; basically uses templates like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions introduced at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary templates are all non @-@ pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be of any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . &quot;
&quot; these templates are useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can include everything from a comment on a final note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As template save as a local template . &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dropping onto the tree view template . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files you can select tree view to a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can forward he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically join &amp; PHP ; design , insert or associate with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog will appear :
&quot; a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless it would appear explicitly . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text edi@@ t@@ stone . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder . &quot;
allows previous or re@@ generated text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers for a whole presentation using special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( showing right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source editor when needed , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 is activated , this mode is already active , pushing the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set via settings Qu@@ anta ... After choosing V@@ PL ; view , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; if you want to change the title of the website , tools document properties are to be selected . this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor can be created . this will also help to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the page in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list . a change over the list is possible just like with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; it is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marker functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting using the back button or removal key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed every other tag anchor tag . &quot;
some tool lists such as the T@@ ables Wizard or the Listen Wizard are disabled . you will be later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release the tables or lists must be used .
&quot; in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be followed . &quot;
&quot; around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to compile successfully , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the most loaded style file fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is loading for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a default name , the QNAP or a specified model name will be checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP &apos;s template that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be expanded according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested retention point has to be resolved for the UR@@ I and line number associated with it . this is automatically performed when loading the first template through x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re@@ assessed shortly after the start of each run .

&quot; start a shell . then type the &quot; &quot; help &quot; &quot; command to get an overview of the help . &quot;
adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation for the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
&quot; exec@@ utes the conversion 20 times , if --@@ repeat is twice as specified , the conversion is executed 100 times &quot;
the input documents are treated as HTML files if support for it has been activated in Lib@@ XML
&quot; activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document , if the support for it has been enabled in Lib@@ XML . &quot;
&quot; on systems with the Re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can use the arrow keys to scroll through the flow memory of the previously executed commands . &quot;
&quot; multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the command &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; an argument is set in a file named &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name for a template consisting only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
&quot; P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the work folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the merging was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no hints at the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 , could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparative windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently of each other in one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging :
&quot; &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and adju@@ sts to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check the code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 , Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o destination folder &quot;
&quot; open dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialog will notice your selection and display it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed . &quot;
&quot; using the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons / merging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , B and C however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other folders . &quot;
&quot; when merging is enabled , the input field becomes active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to set an output file immediately . &quot;
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the same / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison then starts immediately . in the open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can leave nothing out of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
&quot; the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , the color of which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is good in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + Z. B. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the composition column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; the results window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info @-@ line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , every difference must also be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows , where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and maybe select another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker you might copy and paste anywhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the results window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ es the numbers or ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating mainly with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the delivery window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the composition columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Up / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is checked , whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copy is removed . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use the new@@ line character \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , so you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically upon completion and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pushing the tab@@ ul@@ ator key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press Enter or Return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly accepted choice on the operating system used .
&quot; while comparing files , &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . even when merging white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only save a new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; . normally , the cart return signs are made visible , however , like a white character . while merging , this option must be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow on very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict continues . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merging menu . &quot;
&quot; these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . for details , see documentation for directory comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will app@@ end the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must quit &amp; diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to activate the change . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language will be set globally through the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; above the fields for coding a short note appears , which is the local encoding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files can be compared and merged with different encoding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the word processing command can only be handled by 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can specify the encoding of output commands . &quot;
this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded transition column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison windows side by side or above each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . current file merging in the merging menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge operation then the name of the last output file will be retained . )
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal word processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only on line spac@@ ing . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this command line for line spac@@ ing to convert input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword sub@@ stitution .
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line spac@@ e.@@ sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and any hit will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from one another . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / Re@@ placement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line spac@@ ing algorithm looks like .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line spac@@ ing pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders with &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting
... can simulate the merging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing them
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog box .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not merging . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be notified of a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed which have been compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can un@@ fold a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories can be opened and all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can un@@ fold or un@@ fold all the folders . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the merging action cannot be selected automatically . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the columns A / B / C are used in the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical when all content is identical . then also folders have the same color . at folders the age is in@@ significant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the Synchron@@ ize mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the Synchron@@ ize option is active . then select &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders will be identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after merging &amp; ch@@ ub@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) enabled , then check &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during merging , one file will be processed after the other . you specify the status column if the merge was successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the alignment dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected record ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge operation . &quot;
&quot; note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ ding mode C will be used as the target , for the two @-@ folder merge , B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing , A and / or B will be used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , check that all entries that should be in the destination folder also appear in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( short@@ cut ) to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid interaction actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Run , simulate and Cancel . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , a merging window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , choose again start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually merged , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ members ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again during the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge action was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that are ignored by CVS . many aut@@ op@@ tically generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems a previous dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , symbolic link@@ ages are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned off , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; the complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when they are equal . this can be useful , for example , if the change date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in a way that both folders are identical . also , the results of merging files are saved in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging , the copy of the newer file will be suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e as it is assumed that the other file has not been changed too . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of single files , not only merging entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible at the merging of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the current file merging from the merging menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder together . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path can be relative or .. included . it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or change dates . therefore , the permissions or modification date differ from the original . ( note the option &quot; &quot; Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size &quot; &quot; ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as a Differ@@ ence Viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts first and foremost the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; performed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now they are compact ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 indicates that it can be combined like the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot using the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ Diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines are next to each other , this is the attribute this is often the case . &quot;
this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra an own file format that could store this information .
&quot; you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position , or replaces the current selection . &quot;
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after modifications to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they are removed again when clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in particular characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , end them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to the other .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only displays the two entries P@@ ager ... and End . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . the commands do the following : &quot;
maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ tops . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid appear , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for viewing on the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings ... let the dialog box appear .
&quot; currently , this can &apos;t be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base is , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE base packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a full manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ likes ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; if you like &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . below , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ in mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor position . please note that &amp; K@@ may ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document again loaded in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and small &amp; etc ; &quot;
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier to view the screen printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor per@@ si@@ sts on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) and that each mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor per@@ si@@ sts at the same position . it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) and can em@@ ulate the dra@@ gging with the mouse . however , this requires little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the mere moving of the mouse pain . suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it once more : also if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary means , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently move is switched on , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse happens in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this moves in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .t@@ xt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound appears del@@ aying , you can drag and k@@ de to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buff@@ ers , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , is &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at every startup of &amp; k@@ de ; at the moment , this function is only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already cli@@ cked the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use the preferences . in particular , the intelligent displacement you should let off first . if you have become accustomed to the automatic click , you can later take the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not link any link does not lead to unwanted reactions . therefore , you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you have a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue exec@@ uting mouse clicks and putting the cursor in another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action where you want to handle the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t use the smart move if you just start using it and use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this is played every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when you are intelligent moving the shift time . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . &quot;
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and they are correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pressing the mouse button briefly as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter slow@@ s down . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who are suffering from the an@@ aesthetic of the Mau@@ sta@@ che . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list with the conversation course that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text pass@@ code . from text passages you can often choose used text passages without typing it . text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the vocabulary for the vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and an over@@ flow memory of the spoken sets ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; when you start k@@ mouth correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is app@@ ended to the memory memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash cards , voice output and settings , the side notation and the K@@ TT@@ SD speech service page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the box map , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop down box below the input field , specify the character encoding to be passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text further . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possibility kt@@ ts@@ d as a speech service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD speech service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d speech service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passages menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the main memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered only in the input field . &quot;
the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text passages allows you to specify whether the text message script should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
&quot; save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text message book will not be saved . select Before saving , you will be asked if the text message book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop down box if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the drop down box the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply retri@@ eved by counting the assignment . additionally you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; add new entered words automatically into the dictionary , generate a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main part of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; you can add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , the selected text will be used , otherwise the selected parts of the flow storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , the selected text will be used , otherwise the selected parts of the flow storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a movable tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar can be moved by default from the editing pane directly under the menu bar . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow strip in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a movable bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is located by default over the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not have the command for the voice @-@ over@@ s correct or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth , set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the instruction for voice output on the voice file voice output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival free of charge and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ tet folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send the data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service which provides all &amp; k@@ de applications with a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use it as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD speech service page , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can send text by the calcul@@ ator . a list of already spoken phrases is saved , which the user can always release again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth is not a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer needs to be installed on the computer .

an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa Database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ mailing list . subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de file . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you must install and correct program speech @-@ pat@@ cher programs . &quot;
&quot; on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors are set up , the card file speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card General will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . they should also set up multiple versions for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ool for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card rider Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the tab card will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all speakers that are already set up will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select one of the speakers from the list and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ;
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girl voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost always use . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the Language distribution system from &amp; k@@ de . click on the &quot; &quot; General tab &quot; &quot; tab in order to open this tab . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and check the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ m@@ gr is terminated , &amp; kt@@ ts exp@@ ires ; next , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ read is complete . &quot;
&quot; you can start , cancel , stop and record text jobs using the buttons in this row . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an assignment . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the &quot; &quot; General tab &quot; &quot; and select &quot; &quot; En@@ able Voice Output &quot; &quot; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text that is to be read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text first . first check , ob &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read , and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , noti@@ fying you of events that you have set up . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ ma@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; it is useful to improve pron@@ unciation to replace wrong@@ ly spoken words or short@@ cuts , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the way of working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
&quot; news has the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &apos;re &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you receive from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four types of order are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reader is reading , this output is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
&quot; character sets replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre @-@ defined character label replac@@ ements , which allow transl@@ ating chat identi@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speech selection filters , you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card reader , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . the editing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the creation of string collection filters , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparative patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced against the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text to the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . if you load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to see a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages by clicking the &amp; C@@ trl key . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs is available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , the application ID is kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; when all the input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; terms &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package ambig@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the Spe@@ aker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the tab card or to a speaker with specific properties . for example , you can set text by k@@ mail to be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it with a click on the button to get help in the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you can specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to show the speaker selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the pron@@ unciation filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so S@@ able does not work at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be corrected by a string release filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own a license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package node with &amp; kt@@ ts ; then download it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the source code of locally ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer at the supported languages . also check the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that is not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile , compile , need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the c@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive , or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the sp@@ d @-@ conf shell script . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the program speech @-@ pat@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back set or set , repeat , stop or ab@@ ort the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application leaves text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can indicate the features of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and its gender it is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add Spe@@ aker on the tab , then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the tab card institution will be displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules you will find below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting will be automatically made . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers and display them gray , the voice you have selected does not allow these settings to be selected . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi @-@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) . &quot;

the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in case of doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained orders are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ o@@ unces messages . if you &apos;ve just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , warnings and the issues of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;

&quot; Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 free , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds share text into individual sets . this way &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized or stop or stop , even if the speech synthes@@ izer is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you see the set limits recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set border recognition filter is automatically set up as a default . you can modify its settings or add other set border recognition filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the subscri@@ ber selection by trying out . turn off the sel@@ ector selection and enter text to read . switch off the voice selection , change some properties and check the selection of the speaker . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set border recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
phrase Rec@@ ogni@@ tion Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for phrases and insert a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering ) . note that the standard set of set marks keeps the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ due ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set of set limits from default , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card reader selection , you can over@@ write the voice settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card board speaker ) . in other words : there are no Spe@@ aker properties defined .
&quot; using the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of an appointed speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , most likely con@@ forms to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature doesn &apos;t play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application is sent text in a different language other than the one set in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the area of speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker &apos;s select button and then use the speaker that matches the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is written for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; tim@@ e.@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . with G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , the Command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 is installed . if the problem is not resolved , you may have a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work when I play music with another application at the same time . if I hold a text order , it freezes and kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; a message that says : &quot; &quot; Un@@ able to open PC@@ M &quot; &quot; appears . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions please visit the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / cap@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts / moun@@ ts / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts@@ d / moun@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ izer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are quite courage@@ ous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ forming filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want websites to be read with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added my own character chain replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or return . on the card guide orders are indicated , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter out . use a filter for punc@@ tu@@ ation detection instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
gam@@ ers in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; execute the Command Register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes when you start a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is read yet . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ x audio program is used for general speaking speed setting , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded a tar@@ ball ( tar packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime @-@ dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . the configure option for activating the setting shows the configure parameter , which causes the passing of the creation . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

CD k@@ de@@ xing echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . for help , see the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example , ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore search for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like for example co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; from it the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language extension system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates speech from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create those Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phon@@ e. more information can be found under .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders will be installed , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in one sole ; on the command line . &quot;
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu _ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings will be displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers must already be fully installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all displays and the setting of network properties possible . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
the network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , click the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the Ri@@ der network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the dialog box can be edited .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Exten@@ ded settings shows the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; the automatic mode uses TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are at the same time with the start of system services . DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information for each system startup , so no further setup is required . &quot;
&quot; with the Manu@@ ell option , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface for bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device bar .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . by ping in the &amp; con@@ sole ; you can see if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched off as required . switching on a disabled network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking port ....
&quot; network devices can be enabled or switched off , depending on your needs . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface available on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be added by selecting an entry and ascending or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list using the Hin@@ ts or Her@@ on buttons . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from the group of hosts to the nam@@ esp@@ ace a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... There will be the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of names known by name describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains names of names known by names containing &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test is to replace version 4 in the future . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Un@@ named Computer will be displayed .
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
it is sufficient to install binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended by experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology ; in the second chapter , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; variable configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is attributable to a network interface . in external networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is as@@ cer@@ tained or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a reserved area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own host ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising that in case of active DSL connections another content is found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is re@@ ass@@ or@@ ted by scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different stand than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change users &quot; schedules . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ pack . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; re@@ vise the tape and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . do not recognize &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing force on the tape does not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; detects &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was included . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration needs to be solved first . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting data . if your tape drive pres@@ upp@@ oses that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , floppy disks usually require format@@ ting the tape , DA@@ T drives are not format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , you continue with the format of the tape . all the data on the tape will be lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folder .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up Settings for Backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog window will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can initi@@ alize the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the Settings for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput of data and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file by means of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a safety profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files that are located in the same file system are protected as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files has not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings above the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete device file path for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape recorder .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted , and dat ; before the tape is involved , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tried &amp; dat ; the ej@@ ection of the tape drive to lock . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; when the option is turned on , it will automatically be dis@@ car@@ ded when solving the integration of &amp; dat ; the band will automatically be dis@@ car@@ ded . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tried &amp; dat ; the hardware @-@ loaded block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must communicate the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band id . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system stores the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems encountered on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , attempts to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which help the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log . will not be displayed to you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you do not have permissions to read under Linux . the log files usually do not have permission to read for the normal user . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be shown if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the process column , and carry out all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of level note . the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled in Configuration dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the to add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log on the menu in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org . you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for the control of program start at startup of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and that &apos;s because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might try to convert a machine to system V in@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders : &quot;
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to run when you run the system or switch to another run@@ level . system services include such things like Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default Run@@ time is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . in the initial area you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ time 3 is 3 . if you want to change this , then you can change / etc / init@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed something together , then you will get it repaired by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other hand device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry in the area of available system services to one of the six Run@@ time to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the realm of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : there is currently no way to restore entries that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work areas ( Available system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or lower ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry , press Enter to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the default Run@@ time to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be OK ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ Level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplify the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply terminated if their configuration files are not available or set up in@@ correctly . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group by double @-@ clicking on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some flash cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
the card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if it is enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the fil@@ esystem with space restrictions .
