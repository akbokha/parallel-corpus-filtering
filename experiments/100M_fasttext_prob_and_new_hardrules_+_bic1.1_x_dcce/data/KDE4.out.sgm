<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore you should not make important decisions on the translations without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">"only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish website, where you can insert translated texts directly."</seg>
<seg id="5">"package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by & konqueror; by making them more readily available."</seg>

<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; displays another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-Maps indicates the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the dimensions of the sub-objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView, the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily detected if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap is a rectangle which represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can either be depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if sufficient space for representation is present or whether the area of subordinate rectangles occur. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"with display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be adhered to that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how to split the area of an entry for the child entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through boxes to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recurrent branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can designate the minimum represented area for an entry on the menu entry View stop area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitization; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get started & digitized; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instruction to login to the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">"you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply type the path name or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam, you will also use as an albenlibrary. settings digicam set up collections"</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders. & digikam; considers every subfolder as an album."</seg>
<seg id="68">"& digitised; recursively, recursively the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude subfolders except it is in hidden folder. this allows you to add a point before the name of the subfolder."</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList will not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using this on the folder icon."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up and digitize your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My List templates to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu assistance menu."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section roh-deodersettings and roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"a camera interface that is easy to use will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digiti.More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gPhoto2. of course, every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiti.Together."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as disk drive. the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgPhoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read by some libgPhoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the expression support is not available in libgPhoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things & digitized; is how easy it can expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE image plug-in interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & digitized; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that you can't put an image in keywords, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the toolbar at the moment. so the filter on the filename only works if this ind symbol view is displayed. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the View & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digitized are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, according to the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Importioning Images. you can also add a screenshot to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the picture with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and album features to give you information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. if you want to add or delete new collections from the toolbar, you can do so in the collections for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"buttons Eldest, Average, New Year: these put the date on the oldest, newest picture or the average of the album. this first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of last change of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first have an album in & digikam, open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlipiquot; selected. this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes, the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="95">"& digitised; supports input of keywords for single photos in the area My keywordlist on the left bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can, of course, use both methods to organize your photos."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album for the first time, you need to wait short while the preview images are generated. this allows you to avoid using the Extras All thumbnails in the Tools menu."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information about each image is displayed below the preview window. which information this is, you can edit the Edit Settings. select the albums page and customize the preview images to suit your preferences."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest over a picture. the help displays the most important properties including all keywords in a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction into the main window displays such an auxiliary window.</seg>
<seg id="100">"albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to them. you can choose between viewing images, slideshow or editing images."</seg>
<seg id="101">"you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Picture Editing... or the context menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit.... in the Edit page, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos."</seg>
<seg id="102">"it can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual."</seg>
<seg id="103">"some programs do not store these data when you store the modified image. therefore, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc."</seg>
<seg id="104">The easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">"to change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you will keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;)."</seg>

<seg id="107">"the View & quot; My dates list; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam, uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file."</seg>
<seg id="108">"if you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="109">"keywords are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. tags are stickers, which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or finding a search."</seg>
<seg id="110">"when a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="111">"tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list, so that you can find the keywords you are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs."</seg>
<seg id="113">"you can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword, or on an existing keyword and then selecting a new keyword. if you have clicked a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword."</seg>
<seg id="114">"you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo."</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and then drop it there. then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be only once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting a keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the key and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">"to select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword. alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview of the images and select keywords from the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="119">"you can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc."</seg>
<seg id="120">"once you have completed a photo with keywords, this will appear in the preview of the image in the main window."</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the tags menu Remove. the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">"the timeline view shows a time-dependent adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a timeframe, you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. thus, all related images are displayed in the main window."</seg>

<seg id="139">"from the preview toolbar, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window."</seg>
<seg id="140">"another mode is better suited to quickly extract from a series of images. if you use pairs to navigate from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the area for comparison."</seg>
<seg id="141">"of course, the normal deletion operations work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file editing...."</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the luminous table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">"at the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pan function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB. in the preview, both images will show the same image area."</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. just use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">"digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photographs records, scans or stores digital photos carries a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way."</seg>
<seg id="146">"we give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your images, find, protect, and use photos. here, we focus on the process for digital photographers who are & digitized; using. we consider downloading, renaming, converting, regenerating, rating, review, wait and export of image files."</seg>
<seg id="147">"& quot; Digital Inventory takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transformations, confectioned and exports content that holds a monetary or cultural value."</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">"I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no stock management to find a certain photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digitized;. the approach to store the metadata both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats freely."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you need to decide if you want to have access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. note that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point."</seg>
<seg id="151">"you may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photographs, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>

<seg id="219">"there is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day."</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two times: one of the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync copies only the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>

<seg id="229">This question should be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is available to everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the Council is quite easy: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>

<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore."</seg>
<seg id="238">"it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms."</seg>
<seg id="239">"TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, with some cameras you can store your images in this format. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types."</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a licence-free and open format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed due to the need to unify the camera ear formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available to help Canon and Nikon use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource blockquot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata placement quot;, a mix of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP does it because it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when you link between the metadata file and the image file, and as indicated above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of application and business models. DCMI's activities include the work in the DCMI communities and DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices."</seg>

<seg id="297">"setting PNG compression allows you to reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression."</seg>
<seg id="298">"with the TIFF files option, you can compress the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF image. it does not affect image quality, since the Deflate algorithm works lossless."</seg>
<seg id="299">"lossless JPEG 2000 files can save you lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning."</seg>
<seg id="300">"in the earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only an image viewer for photos. currently, it evolves very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing."</seg>
<seg id="301">"if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option marks the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">"this setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard, it is based on a fixed color balance, which was photographed in sunlight on a white card."</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that under exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the standard is the top-lights, so the parts of your images are burned in due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights as a penetrating white."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digikam, and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the Reconstruction option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture."</seg>
<seg id="308">"set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the Edit & Edit image options. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservative."</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial rohdata that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour reproduction.</seg>

<seg id="318">"there are other options such as the Soft Proof profile, which allows you to emulate how your image would be given from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this can be corrected manually, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired outcome."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image editions are per email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and get thoughts about color management ng?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor since sRGB means that your monitor is callicalibrated on sRGB. if you work as in the colour space of sRGB, you either need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve an image in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, synchronize, Automatic balancing and contrast extend from the menu Correction Automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values across the whole picture so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">"similar: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="392">"this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jiamacoustic of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited since a colour space with 8-bit per color is worked. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in the 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Color whitespace of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. if you want to see the original white color again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play the stat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview in order to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed.. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Upload buttons make exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original.</seg>
<seg id="406">"here you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"this & digitized; tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar radiation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that arose when one partially developed a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the coloured, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted coloured film made by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can view the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex mold gradation and the simple luminous strength / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on sound correction for the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you will need only the range of the sliders for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and make sure the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light sounds and the lowest for the medium tones, often called gamma values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: using these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. for this, the Gimp level format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and Sonnentöne. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator control adjusts all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">State-of-the-art channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode is mostly the most useful. in this case, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a short part to the right, i.e. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and darken the associated image pixels."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image sharper. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather psychedelic. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined into a common color. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. SLR cameras normally need more after sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera is often used internal sharpness. images in the raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable them, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this can be used with the menu entry for Correcting Field."</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique is to focus on correcting the tool. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to soften the softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first be tried out. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will generate near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount between the original and the blurred image will be added to the original. this will make the strength of the sharpness set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example for the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The digitized tool refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colours in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which also depends on the source pixies that are far from the original quellpixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the markup effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0 the image quality is very poor."</seg>
<seg id="502">"use this parameter to avoid annoying artifacts. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the Gauss. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that there are lots of operations that are not immediately visible, but which later leave nasty artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. even under optimal conditions the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been done with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the focus correction methods in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothens the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available defaults are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes uniformly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film gradient or CCD noise, a high value of wave-like patterns will be generated. JPEG Artefakte are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">"repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, one or two is sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="524">"angular focal length da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, it should also be selected small. therefore, make sure that small angles make a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation: the increase in quality you receive by choosing this option is only low. however, it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend that you leave it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Upload buttons make this exactly. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photograph that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitized noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable images filter to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window will stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">"the radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time needed for the filter per pixel and can blurb the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors corrected."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong you cannot remove the entire noise or to remove noise peaks. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak hissing or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the image settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically smoother.</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the excitation that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpness. use tool to soften softness with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitized; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film gradation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or later digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting. the texture replacement is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for the restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG Artefakte reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">Each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film gradient on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="552">"below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photograph that was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2)."</seg>

<seg id="561">"Durcut: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are used to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to compute a bi-square interface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="565">"below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"the digitization; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetectable quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise blurred effects are caused by motion."</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an aquivalente transformation on a raw screen made without this filter. the tool Vignetting corrections turns the transformation with a center filter onto a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 2, or randomly to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vignetting."</seg>
<seg id="572">"brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controller only provides positive values, since you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a better readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit menu; image processing from the Color Gradation menu."</seg>

<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth gradient corrects the remote corners to that of the second gradient. if you combine these two can almost eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, clayered distortions can be corrected and positive values are vertiginous distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">This value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'Corner Parameter' has the inverted character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the tone or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or resizing. the best way is to perform this correction as the first one. if you want to re-cut an image and then perform a tonne-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong."</seg>

<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"this is known by classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of films, manufacturers mix large silver granules of photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film gradation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grained vision specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grade effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digitized filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">"the digitized, filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect."</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large images. smoothes the smoothing or, from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">Images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch around you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digitized; Filter Grave shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">"the filter engravings are a quick tool to re-give your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects take long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Zoom: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in the field of sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographing from a car or train."</seg>
<seg id="619">"softening blurring: blurring the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Vibrating blurring: blurring the image by random shift of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color basins in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it through the filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects take a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Beenden button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool for making raindrops on your image. it gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can use the & digitized; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen Filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirroring or turning into the correct orientation."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you re-invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select Transform size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"change the size of the tool using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try the tool for inflating."</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation for example Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo blown was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain the aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any single-click for a photo can be saved as text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">"inflating a photo is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Beenden button."</seg>
<seg id="639">The original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">"editing a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle as you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl-button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X)."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool Following aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"cutting tool Following aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons have to be centered horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">"below in the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"when using the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settling aid settings allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden centre: the golden centre is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf leaves of a sunflower."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third angel the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to draw the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles are also derived from the golden spiral of the above. their vertices are the middle-points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal angles. diagonal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamischer."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal and Vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the color button, you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it's easy to hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the digitized image editing and tool free rotation."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"to your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can position it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have turned a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the Transformers function from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image is a little spared. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming knife cutting from image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal loop, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle will be turned into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"rotate your image by using Horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle is set to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you've done the scaling, the picture will get a bit blurred. for a single layer this effect is usually negligible, but two layings produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing the picture has some triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate these is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">"digitized; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats."</seg>
<seg id="684">"because of this dependency on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below."</seg>
<seg id="685">"& digikam; displays only files in formats that you know. this is done by means of file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can change the file extension."</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you even to select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">"JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also store lossless when specified in the settings."</seg>

<seg id="856">"you can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you are planning to process your images frequently or later use it elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion progresses."</seg>

<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, computes and links & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling takes the neighbouring pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is always split up and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels, which are individually pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce noise for the ray process, called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoder explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; add titles to the keywords when encoding MP3s with lame, the switch -tt by lame and the title parameter from & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>

<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database, in which persons can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is written: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translation: that means the author) am not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. when & kaudiocreator is set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>

<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the coder can be used. this is also required for the predefined coders. more information about Kodierer is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>

<seg id="1588">"note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed."</seg>

<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to play on tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch-127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), similar to a gun shot. to do this, please enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where every note represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum (like some keyboards own it)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"Keymaps are used above all to map out sounds on the percussion channel. for example, take a look at the provided key maps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to change the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap must be defined with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender-Event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to play a bit with & kmid; try it around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). you can see which sounds are played on these keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button will no longer be green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played notes. view the View menu in the Settings menu under the Channel View menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)"</seg>

<seg id="2038">"if there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions."</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the suitable toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most important extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you must create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE configuration file [tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index element = your description for these documentation for example & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see the documentation in PHP and PHP."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which serves to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation is displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the separable resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at various points there is an email-sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD Package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. we recommend that the contributions are checked and only available when our team is looking for a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for your personal GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and by clicking OK the upload will be started."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool lists toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, check & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature. in case of problems it warns and it can then be cancelled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in tagXML format."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD File menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to tool lists with special promotions specially designed for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the carton guides with information and the toolbars. please refer to, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all card trajders, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right click in the editor area to another context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing (cutting / copy / paste), editing the tags located under the mouse pointer or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top of the editor window, the toolbars of the editor are located. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"using tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert data for this just tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the Baumansions (QIT;) allow you to navigate and browse in the information about & quantaplus; for files, projects, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views are available."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project Management is a powerful tool providing & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading, or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the contextual menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus, is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole web page & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the relevant user and templates in projects are only available in the project."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands is opened in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"this tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can be changed. the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be appended, edited and considered project-specific documentation."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"by default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, which can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window."</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email they can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"if you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH before your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why & Kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no hints at the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & Kdiff3, could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparative windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & knu3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"this is useful when two people work independently of each other in one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kDiff3; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & codiff3; when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& Kdiff3; displays the exact differences and adjusts to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check the code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are shown visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"diff3 Folder 1 Folder 1 Folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3, Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 -o destination folder"</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. open dialog will notice your selection and display it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"using the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons / merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, B and C however, a folder, then uses & kDiff3; the file name from A in the other folders."</seg>

<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kDiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison then starts immediately. in the open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can leave nothing out of & Kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"if a difference is detected, the color of which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is good in the next section (merge)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + + Z. B., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)"</seg>

<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal word processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only on line spacing. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your requirements. each input line must have an associated output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line for line spacing to convert input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically created strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword substitution.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>

<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / RegExp / Replacement / SCHALTER 'However perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line spacing algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line spacing preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file by means of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can re-create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a safety profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>

<seg id="2929">You can set the settings above the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete device file path for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape recorder.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmitted, and dat; before the tape is involved, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed."</seg>

<seg id="2934">"the option is turned on, tried & dat; the hardware-loaded block size for the tape drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must communicate the block size for your tape drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"if & dat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"(n Byte) The band id. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the tape was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system provides the various protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system stores the various protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems encountered on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, attempts to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with which help the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log. will not be displayed to you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you do not have permissions to read under Linux. the log files usually do not have permission to read for the normal user."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be shown if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the process column, and carry out all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more eye-catching color than protocol lines of level note. the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled in Configuration dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can use the to add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& kSystemlog; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log on the menu in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named as) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init quickly becomes the standard for the control of program start at startup of the system in the & Linux; world. and that's because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might try to convert a machine to system V init without reinstalling and reformatting. therefore, you must make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to run when you run the system or switch to another runlevel. system services include such things like Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"the rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. in the initial area you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runtime 3 is 3. if you want to change this, then you can change / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have messed something together, then you will get it repaired by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or any other hand device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry in the area of available system services to one of the six Runtime to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the realm of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries that were thrown into the Recycle Bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator key to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or lower ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry, press Enter to open the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings are recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runtime to a reasonable value (3 should usually be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under RunLevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplify the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated if their configuration files are not available or set up incorrectly."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flash cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group by double-clicking on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flash cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if it is enabled and initialized for at least one built-in filesystem space limitation (quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the filesystem with space restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can be a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the Properties of the group dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work similarly."</seg>
