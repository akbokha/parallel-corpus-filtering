&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is enormous .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American writers and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can &apos;s letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to appeal to his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about its size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain , as it is said so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number , ever reaching a candidate nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alism program , who takes people from all over the world , a deeply dis@@ beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung , too , did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew leak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , who helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values incar@@ n@@ ated by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp was making its way to the nom@@ inations of Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as sha@@ kers .
&quot; assign@@ ing people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country they have disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note ) : as much as &quot; &quot; le@@ aning the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as the Great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , there is a huge portion of the white American promise of this promise , saying , &quot; Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd was ro@@ aring .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices became lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is Tru@@ mp@@ s Land now , the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what is the Mexican Music School of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Municip@@ ality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played in both places has not only changed the children &apos;s lives , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) plays in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become central interest to the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the commune , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs of gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare ray of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled material : &quot;
&quot; music with restored instruments composed of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of garbage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , re@@ members the beginning : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ sal and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made up of tr@@ ash .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and that is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of garbage each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est ones - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle from tr@@ ash music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known back then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this kind at their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to take one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority , is a member of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it did not succeed in catching fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for the lo@@ oting of the fish stocks in the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the premi@@ er out of their waters back then . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , which is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions are now happening in real time , trac@@ eable at the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activity or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible for authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered , such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay sanctions , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm which advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million of lost revenue , which will lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fishermen who enter East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries that attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; their practices include such actions as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of f@@ anta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they pur@@ pos@@ efully use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ un@@ broken control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; earlier a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You &apos;re not able to run my harbour . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had disper@@ sed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered from satellites . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Cop@@ eland is helping to build a system that combines different information levels . F@@ ISH @-@ i should help to find crimin@@ ally acting vessels with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships that were previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly expected consequences will now know that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile reported a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses since then . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually due to illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined together , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ position of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the inauguration , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void , gathering in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the return of Venezuela ) both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas low@@ land region , in the Andes regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally @-@ north @-@ located federal parliament of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication .
&quot; many of the opposition leaders saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end , the holding of a new election was blocked by official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , the demonstr@@ ators called on to support the National Assembly on 27 October . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;
&quot; Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; Re @-@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could leave the cathedral safe again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile an inf@@ ographic already makes the round that depic@@ ts the extent of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an office building procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s about this :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado assert that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your office release !
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which from its point of view has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to mu@@ te critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as a meanwhile grown man , Qui@@ j@@ ano was now in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , examined crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; he started to bear the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept his family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that it was ok . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not yet realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ maid . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was charged with kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the scale of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy , who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP systems . &quot;
make sure you don &apos;t have to kidn@@ ap you one day and then I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inia revolutionary workers &quot; party . &quot;
therefore he charged me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would be a secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the base of the military , I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack in which cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I looked inside and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
&quot; they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 Vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible for a man to do so much harm to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore hands . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people were silent on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you come up with me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me of it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms have been designated as offices . &quot;
I know &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , charges the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , goes through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order came from above that they should be mis@@ placed . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as they knew - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military insignia which one takes on an enemy that is fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , this is not a war of war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who steal cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
&quot; for this , we need no one else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photograph from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar swe@@ ater made of wool . both of them had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to his home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I get older , I feel regret . &quot;
&quot; when you first have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them in jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to whom one could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that can be done to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course something always remains .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
the thought to display my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to witness .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed horrible crimes and you forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I posted the first advertisement .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases , and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the Jud@@ gments of the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years .
eleven of the originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Perm judgement : murder ; torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ warm state terrorism
&quot; all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for years for justice for the victims . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial could be built there , which is now being led by human rights organisations . &quot;

translation errors makes elderly people in Kyoto a &quot; terrible driving &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , in the last month witnesses of a particularly un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; , was fal@@ sely mistaken - but perhaps also with evil h@@ ind@@ sight &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; being translated as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos shared in many social media .
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he also paid attention to the local newspapers . &quot;
the newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n &apos;s published in Kyoto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite proper name &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text that they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger wrote about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; elderly mot@@ ori@@ sts in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ ori@@ sts . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ ori@@ sts who are involved in accidents across the country is also a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by senior citizens increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the published version of the article , the un@@ named repor@@ ter published comments on the light which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese have apparently le@@ aned against older mot@@ ori@@ sts : &quot;
the article on Yahoo over the translation error received among other things the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; ) about not reality ?
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How accurate is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to transmit active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; a French native speaker , for example , should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can nevertheless make translations company @-@ internal . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is assessed as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the verb@@ alized and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , produced by machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints which often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship in the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eger con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ ended , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : enable your VPN .
it seems that websites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ Sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which DNS servers respond correctly to requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies faul@@ ty or refuses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v ; @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , stopped the broadcast on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV returned to the show . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans are getting more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ mean . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collects witness testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ tic@@ ta who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo taken by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of Cur@@ ti .
the following article is the shortened version of a nut@@ shell &apos;s report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Fall Schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as a cri@@ ol@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money sur@@ passes their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty which cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice , known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay as a result of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimony , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ mean Delta is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who has her daughter in the belief that she can finish her training , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of herself &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon occurred in the sec@@ rec@@ y in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly after she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was in the household of the former military family Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who acts as an official in the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra defeated Mar@@ Ã­n as long as it suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ es .
&quot; organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , who were deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , were responsible for the death of the girl . &quot;
they called the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest meetings and demanded that &quot; no further Carolina &quot; can occur in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; more cows than children are registered in Paraguay , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl , who was her Cri@@ tic@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ cket
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour , but they live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost her father &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; her brothers now had to work all the time , and began selling cand@@ y on the street or on the market in order to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Cri@@ mean City .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they clean the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I could fetch more books from the house &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand alongside him and read editorial from opposition papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he thought it intellig@@ ently , but did not pause with her . &quot; the host had found someone who heard while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; bad habits there . &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would return home to Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ at home . &quot;
&quot; her masters were afraid that they would lose the education they had allowed her to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ cans who are exposed to Cri@@ tic@@ ta when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ st@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , during the time of friendship , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Company endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little girl for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ eventh girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary , &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the summary of the ad turned out once more :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the Cri@@ mean del@@ tas report , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ mean del@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former cri@@ es , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we succeeded in aboli@@ shing systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the wives of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors went into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill stipul@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted for a bill to &quot; regulate the use and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established in order to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as a &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice , video news and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is unclear how the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament &apos;s deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are forced by violent public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a strong monitoring system in order to filter citizens who apply for approval or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a court case . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative Parliament and the constitutional Committ@@ ees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ Fis@@ her@@ y decre@@ ed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was fores@@ een for those who are found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kurdish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq marked by war

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Ti@@ ersch@@ Ã¼tz@@ erin H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the s@@ ini@@ ster Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the greater family of Leop@@ ards , who wi@@ ped through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video suggests that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera @-@ all , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist R@@ aza likes to show passion@@ ately a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies of wild living animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an area .

&quot; in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress that had been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was an important pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring islands Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal cities from the map .
&quot; in addition to this , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced an atomic accident , even for that reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress six years later were achieved to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as pol@@ l results of the victims themselves .
&quot; the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement buildings ( the company , the company , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ te ju@@ te ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma constitutes 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , six years after the disaster , the evacu@@ ated of lodging establishments ( the company , the company , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ te ak@@ u ) were still trying to reloc@@ ate to final replacement buildings . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 are still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people who were living in shel@@ ters after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by accident , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have res@@ um@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident have suffered enormously in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear inter@@ lock zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far beaten . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same booth as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe , almost half of the coastal population , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough has been done in disasters prevention . &quot;
what about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also focused on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture witnessed the worst , disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led to permanent replacement buildings . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma out of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated people who are still living in lodging establishments are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries speaking different languages , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that more than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike has strengthened her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a popular photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer had hit him with a stick in a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studying social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; doctors operated on him on Saturday , and now transferred him to an artificial coma . &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which rapidly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a cane . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer as he beats in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ z@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary blocks close to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks . &quot;
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian real rel@@ ays ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , only to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police Trans@@ actions
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which last Friday there was a brutal police operation against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have changed street protests by focusing on a different , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window in order to take a picture of their titles illustr@@ atively .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are ob@@ liter@@ ated by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the Municip@@ ality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar crop on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after the fall , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its assets , until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who runs every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members the fact that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; a few decades ago , the news would have been a motive for concern for the country , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old train station of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the com@@ min@@ ution of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose over a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will surely come into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
almost all those questioned are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially recorded documents , which would only differ regarding the parts that would be removed , addressing the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was sur@@ passed and letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the shut @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories read yet , &quot; he assures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; against his will , he was involved in the stopp@@ age of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working class producer was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services generated by the facilities in the communities in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the president of that time saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to res@@ ign , they stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without any future prospects , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the place where he began working . &quot;
forty @-@ nine gro@@ in gave the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ acting person , yet he for@@ gives the lies he told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes to pension for 65 years , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
&quot; since 2014 , a part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour brings workshops and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten C@@ ree communities in North Que@@ bec together with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p Hop group The Northern Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they find in the sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal area of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section called West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs in spite of the influence of globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group , who gave them a stop@@ per in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go forward with our youth
so they can do what it is intended for by the Creator .
&quot; in the commentary box , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the C@@ ree language also contribute to Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) are issued by any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ a , there are a large number of small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend today turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in the special sale : new plastic straps decorated with plastic rib@@ bons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new Boom of Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , an Imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phones :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; you can also view other bizarre plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow us on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , the so @-@ called . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with the drug trade &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people involved in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and so entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something such simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who searches secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , lost her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing again for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me as well . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where shall we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a Les@@ ess of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with illness and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets . &quot;
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; recep@@ tive . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the city district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed by threats . &quot; in it , she describes how armed det@@ ective month paid money from their business until they end up destroying the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of all that you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never fa@@ des , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as you do not know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in those fear@@ ful days I wondered if crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted emotions , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation committed by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had passed two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a force ma@@ stered by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ des per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed battle against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth thousands of un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a ru@@ mor or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether it is true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been used in a mis@@ leading way to see trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , dump@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for many years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes , which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people who looked at the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ coal bodies lying on the ground while people look at them .
but here history does not come to an end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was er@@ ased several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to actual trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , comb@@ at@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically the atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be pic@@ tori@@ ally displayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the image from the DR Congo showed up again when it was mistakenly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ descriptions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example wrong@@ ly reflect the DR Congo image with sources of mass media to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations described the ones who could flee from blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared as the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , wrong@@ ly claimed , the President of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said that monks and politicians participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to see this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , also wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein Sein this statement , but did not bring the picture out of the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an inver@@ ted image search , you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private parties , social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have adopted examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which page they had been published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also inter@@ connected ) , several examples can be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be completely felt ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries refer to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show fake examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only the fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions after the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved therein ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the neighborhood is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ublic@@ a c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ bei@@ ges after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no sides such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the flaw@@ ed use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post by the US American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;

&quot; thus , the formulation of the a@@ stral compos@@ ites , the a@@ stral @-@ min@@ de@@ dness of the world , is composed of : Amen : Amen . &quot;
the sho@@ cking photo you &apos;ve ever seen ! ) .
this page used the image as evidence that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek Fak@@ ten@@ check site in 2013 and again in 2016 .
&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
a German Association of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the picture .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;
a resident of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the DR Congo photo was seen as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an slaughter and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were used impro@@ per . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a judgment on what it meant as &quot; deliberately dark news and photos , which came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this adjustment , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often common by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; flu @-@ ting@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does not show Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein took part in 2012 that monks and politicians participated in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , bringing the story together with the image from S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained therein .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic nearby An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was circul@@ ated later in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the DR Congo image pi@@ cks up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , which allegedly took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pull through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who inad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the distribution of forci@@ ble images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , there is a concern that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media act to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; however , each study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer voice enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ b@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but everyone is stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist@@ ing any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
&quot; most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the im@@ print language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you have been war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state Sri Lanka currently faces the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; due to heavy rainf@@ all , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have come across the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement from the Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people were missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls closed on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased . &quot;
the health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already underway . &quot;
&quot; this morning , the N@@ elu@@ va bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five will be completed for the transport of emergency shipments for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call us the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Pick@@ Me @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cad@@ enza center is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me gave a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then distributed free of charge to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ish Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I attended the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trusted her four years old daughter , she trusted in her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we apply rights to trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend watches me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they are mi@@ tig@@ ating me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow , all of us are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit in as I do not fit into it .
need to be reli@@ eved
I am not alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you think of when you think about it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western vision the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been col@@ oni@@ alizing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed nar@@ rations dominate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and forced Saudi Arabian , Muslim women to cover their entire body , both sides are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim Pra@@ yers have been spoken by Afri@@ cans , who were brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ anti attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the 1.7 billion Nar@@ r@@ ative .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account for the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ American Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; back then , when Khan thought the sky@@ lines of the world were new , my parents were un@@ miss@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ oked , we don &apos;t carry all pocket kit@@ es with us . &quot;
we also do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the United States , see below . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf would see that I am Muslim , if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms and her the Arabic verses for protection , which seal the Koran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat for three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , evil that can be seen and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim sen@@ timent is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the image of my mother mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; how she gained a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings , painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that - over centuries - was colon@@ ised by an empire , which was founded by a company called Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ die @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan grab@@ bed his family in India dominated by K@@ ash@@ mir , family whom he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to me is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at play . &quot;
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have col@@ oni@@ alised all up to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dump@@ ed over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ asch@@ mir under@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread across every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy reaches the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the nar@@ ration of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the reducing tw@@ o@@ fold &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build structural Islamic hos@@ tility . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim regi@@ str@@ ars that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders with people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; that largely respects Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs that we drop in Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous im@@ prints we get in our news articles . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; S@@ ay Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they are domin@@ ating large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me an ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslim today . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia are taking place . &quot;
&quot; more than hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are fought and people are being re@@ united by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public performance , was even a scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I have done in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; stories of history , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk of small and not quite as small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while listening to it is often associated with understanding , &quot; these events instead &quot; listen to , to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers can first translate and translate their story in their own language , or then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation make it possible for the audience to listen to them . &quot;
they cause laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the B@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and organizers hope to extend this . anyone inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story talks . &quot;
Puerto Rico challenges the US to re @-@ establish public debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started with the Mexican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the interc@@ essors of the replacement of debts have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , imposed measures will be at risk of being rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , published excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the real cost associated with it .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat in on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice , who are pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process from temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activities has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , was transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
&quot; however , his place of residence and state remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passes the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pres@@ cient than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of many civi@@ lis@@ ations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in detention . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ z@@ ema , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 to her husband when he was in detention . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
&quot; she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them into English from Arabic . &quot;
the book is freely available .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I s@@ unk in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care for any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will let another piece of my soul be with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ har &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , a minimum of 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption jud@@ g@@ mental director after release again on previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his imprisonment on which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants for mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose Council has ruled Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately requested his re@@ position to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old posts , as the company did not pursue a disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many residents do not say the action is good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the infrin@@ gement .
&quot; the company , however , seems to be silent and does not indu@@ ce reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of them had dropped off . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped cause harm . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has already mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing to return mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself in the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre @-@ charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is heard : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are in the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the mos@@ s , but also as a sharp , ed@@ ging and - by the way - a proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ah also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not like that . &quot; he does not change the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also le@@ aning : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , sitting for 10 years and was free . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally use as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or , as part of an initiative , to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( split@@ ters ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ook believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before killing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm doesn &apos;t understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , carefully analyze and control the mail by checking the words next to them . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( split@@ ters ) .
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading hate speech , have received quite a good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who is spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored words to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook Gui@@ deline , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to upload , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who are simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinions on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , such as the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which gave them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided for a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users . &quot;
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; the post says &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally hei@@ gh@@ ten the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context than on code concentration and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the child &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice so that the age @-@ related age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of marriage , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , at age , does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the Min@@ ors as , , every person under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were anxious to abo@@ lish laws for child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring this result .
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , be dam@@ ned about their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against child marriage was decided - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country has to appro@@ ve and announce the law . &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it was decided against it .
&quot; having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become the law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for child marriage had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk which conce@@ als the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson believed it was definitely long enough to get the practice off , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the sp@@ ouses have been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke of how important the adoption of the law said : &quot;
the age of marri@@ ages in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the change of the married network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were against have voted for the law .
the chil@@ dr@@ ens are no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago by law .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ marri@@ age@@ use .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook is in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to dissolve his promise now . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; instead of talking about discussing so generally rather than talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , that the state , our daughters prevent them from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposite them , would be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the child &apos;s toe is legal or continues to be the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ de with Russia &apos;s Day - the Russian National Day , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website was h@@ acked by Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district . h@@ ack@@ ers have left a funny message &quot; St@@ ay at home . &quot; &quot;

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the site , but in the cache it remained intact . &quot;
it is # gentle
&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ news that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day becomes clearer , how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia as recently as published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , following the adoption of the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now di@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; despite the legal prohibition , the content is also available . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after hearing the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to cover sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a su@@ h@@ len@@ ent r@@ hin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around her . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just looked at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) suddenly called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was on and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar asp@@ ires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , because he was already facing Tig@@ ers face to face : &quot;
a tiger cannot interfere with the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I too was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time . &quot;

&quot; this contribution was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should abuse the norm to preserve this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by an Appe@@ al Court and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married couple with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of calling her wives apart from the name is also common among men . however , they have far less permission to fear , if at all , they should not come after this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel and house@@ wives , entered a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the coverage of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs . &quot;
it tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was about women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they are all guilty of and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name so far , wanted to try at home as it is going on . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this confidence in their luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some thought it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get into motion the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women could never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she would just ch@@ ick herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to let the whole fam@@ ed fru@@ stration go out against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in an adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as carrying the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead , indicating the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ ced point if he did .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot;
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
&quot; it feels great to be able to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they are . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most of them are okay , but some wanted a sage @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , wear ; they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ g@@ gled Roh@@ ini gave her own pair of short del@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club had already changed , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are moving slowly : &quot;
so far we have only done small steps .
&quot; some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling around more freedom of movement or their own clothes choice - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also there .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia were warned the population that bald men could be attacked in Mozambique &apos;s goal .
&quot; photo : An@@ other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald @-@ headed individuals for Organ@@ izing , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC declared . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald @-@ headed men were recorded in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , which is the goal of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to examine this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique travel gl@@ amor@@ ous men in Mozambique are target of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police following the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims had power in the head of power to generate the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa on Facebook , which indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE like to be ashamed of E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ICH fo@@ ams a country in which people would have shame to go on the streets as they would not hurt men or even take their lives in order to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , aimed at getting to fast wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro Sap@@ ange , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald headed : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very worried about the mur@@ ders of people who are being assass@@ inated . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably made just recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published within a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) , having participated in the draft of the 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China will continue to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Peace Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations Com@@ bin@@ ed Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s premi@@ er Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into a shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union of the European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as she said in a statement on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to elev@@ ate all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
you should meet and receive all visits you desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad said that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it assists him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a vote in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife . &quot;

United States of America
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um invited China to provide Li@@ u an adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
&quot; Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and the United States
&quot; on June 29 , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will finally record it . &quot;
Taiwan is one of the most
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very well in a statement on June 28 around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
&quot; the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore was to be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that is , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in view of it , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leave the twisted logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised corresponding questions with the non @-@ answers of rational nature .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to show his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; as An@@ on published his comment on the blog , he points out the criticism that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities were seeing a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in that sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes this and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integrates the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; beli@@ ve a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , will we only be seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; since it plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore pay their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this set seems to have anger@@ ed many Singap@@ ore@@ ans ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should speak more about the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Can@@ adi@@ ans &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series dealing with ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et should be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication follows usually the standard response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly before anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know each other , there is little difference to Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their bags to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country for ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first of all , being called &quot; nice &quot; means being sp@@ iny - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant sil@@ houette of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means being in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major feature of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ding Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ unces the j@@ un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the prec@@ ep@@ ts about his girlfriend .
&quot; although not specifically political , the music video indirectly refers to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook alone was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 songs . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly in relation to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these videos which relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th Rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; setting up &quot; journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , supervised on online content and persons accused of being persecuted by the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand relies on a stri@@ k@@ ered face against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic flights ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the j@@ un@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song became members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ish war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the bas@@ ins of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Sha@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sides in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today for the most part Russians and Ab@@ k@@ asy live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ cc@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to stop this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens serving all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with remaining magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have left the bor@@ ough in the meantime .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty residents live .
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they pull back immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother forbidden us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ han@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dj@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter , insist@@ ing that she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead . &quot;
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
aunt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman , as well as a young family , and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembered the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative main town in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ asha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
she tells us that it was at first a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but actually it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy conf@@ esses us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy pursu@@ es him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; as they run , some of them throw stones on the lap@@ sed buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure authenticity in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in Ted@@ dy B@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez relates , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you m@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy medication they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ arian ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then go north@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the circuit and that Afri@@ cans have already talked to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at M@@ um Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they went to greet them or to tell her about the course of their trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; MS Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ ery place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single instructor , offered him the roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next steps . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , the travellers always consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; MS Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she leaves with numerous photos in her album .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ aving she has made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she imag@@ ines her shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;

&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean@@ ing &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had messages exchanged with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was informed that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans , and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these features can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while noti@@ ons of digital cens@@ orship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; published on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the inhabitants random@@ ly to see if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; Pop@@ ular Educ@@ ational Buil@@ dings , &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can up@@ lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minim@@ ise the dissemination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities , and the party associated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi in order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ bl@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a number of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able both inside and outside .
one who makes all glory to her name .
one who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality brings you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even when Earth is spinning on the axis of evil . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service expressed it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were ri@@ pped during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; cri@@ es .
&quot; all the districts of the city sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
I broke the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; several times from my home roof .
I heard my voice be@@ fallen by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt bold enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined a magnificent picture that filled my expectations full and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are releasing the Spirit out of the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the slightest . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have scre@@ amed them all the way to the office of security service . &quot;
I came there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the colon@@ el of Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am , if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
and you &apos;re really gri@@ eving what to look into my eyes and not on the floor !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause , when I answered : &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father equally with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , right with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence is up to now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I had been exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I pres@@ ide all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , this time they have assigned me a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one prisoner , and I must immediately put myself in place without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I went back to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : hitting the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell was a &quot; &quot; first &quot; &quot; in@@ mate . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a well @-@ known middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness there are no distinctive facial features , and doctors don &apos;t have it here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him , if I stay . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that lab@@ ored in the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us horror in person : the wheel ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the thir@@ teenth S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the security against us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so . &quot;
&quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I have used it to myself , not to answer . &quot;
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to punishment , although I had nothing done to deserve this punishment . &quot;
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cri@@ es .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold back your cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; my cri@@ es were not enough to him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a collector of rub@@ b@@ ish or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped shou@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ors at all , so he grab@@ bed as the next to an electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which occurred to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light meets the space . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spend most of his time indoors , sometimes he hur@@ ls to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ i@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Oriental , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and according to his own statement , he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he har@@ bors a special reluc@@ tance to American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b contem@@ plates his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - so he describes himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own living circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water , Nes@@ cafÃ© sh@@ ook in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
&quot; apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the slu@@ gs speak flu@@ ffy coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic campaign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the proven legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to advoc@@ ate intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be just shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflected a clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b drew up traditional gender norms by creating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently du@@ sty unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they actually should trust .
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos; - the in@@ official out@@ war@@ dly . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still start@@ ling that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in appropriate ways . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to fight crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be kept in prison for in@@ definite time &quot; , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from topics that are long as tab@@ oos in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate from politics his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics have been rich@@ ly wor@@ sen@@ ed &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments were torn from the context , distorted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts but only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was supposed to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , did nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the grounds that they had critical comments on social media comments related to the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s what H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approaching a real and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to drag and resist . &quot;
&quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Cris@@ is Reporting , which A@@ man listened to as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the fe@@ ats , drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and from a period of time when armies of West Japan inv@@ aded the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ aries , to their knees . &quot;
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to snap some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed trucks are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outer appearances and personal care have rarely been as important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which took place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; education institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year starting in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of her successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : sec@@ uri@@ tis@@ ation letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel expelled to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; this was precisely the question of the young Colum@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired her to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la J@@ li@@ aciÃ³n campaign ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla force of F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , forming the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was as significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carrying out their arms round the clock , must now return to life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now assimil@@ ate them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would have to join and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters in order to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need much more need@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent appeal . &quot;
&quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I would never have thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bog@@ ot@@ art Foundation , travelled to the camps to personally persu@@ ade the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept orders from their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the policy @-@ based student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ den &quot; &quot; ( a kind of cottage in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL guard , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty of Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; Hi , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state exer@@ ted itself on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to make society more just in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who have never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people whom I have often seen as monsters and even hate them , are just people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men , including those who killed and so much hurt , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters answered the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons , protest and protest for their rights , and this is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ minent . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;
a woman talks about persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ ko Sum@@ ova and its first published publication on the website OC Media .
&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not made overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that addressed the ab@@ duction , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in gun . &quot;
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the sex balance of their Land@@ s@@ man , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the USA in the final analysis . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents went through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just going to fetch some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you che@@ ek ? &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and began to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
&quot; OC Media : in which cases were you laid , in which of the men or the women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , my male name still stands on it , but the doctor understood and laid me down to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running on top without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was only bad speech , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering with me , without ID , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plu@@ gged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex equ@@ ation , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this mental barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really take effort to look at the person they remember from their past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
&quot; for this , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who had been in gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he said that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut down a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still locked in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : an acquain@@ tance of mine says there were not many .
&quot; if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to establish Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people had not just van@@ ished , but specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports on that yet . we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gros@@ ny when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in the ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was applied , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us closer to &quot; &quot; civili@@ zing &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never even curved my hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
people often say it to children when they laugh at the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ als on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people in the city began to change . &quot;
those who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : which activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize tea re@@ treats , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food types . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
I discovered these people myself when I cut off the influ@@ enza variety .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
&quot; so , nature is , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you sweat in front of your mouth , that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the ro@@ ot@@ ers have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear this . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of tran@@ sist@@ ence for men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be exact , different attitudes of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re@@ pressed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that could arise for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ az@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed this month . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family pat@@ rons , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to cont@@ end their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs working in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ts@@ young people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Manager for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have completed a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland , Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be employed , as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances given by the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional
detail of a photo . recorded by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women - call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments about why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still attracting across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced of this and I suffer double and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : if I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial separation and discrimination , both in and out of the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift their voices up &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are subjected to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman is standing , who refuses to take into account ine@@ qualities in her mind , which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in his speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alised being in a historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , who also absorb our customs and customs by means of cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme . &quot;
&quot; some of them will continue to silence the meaning of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to instruc@@ t them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and narrow down from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to dissolve myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana possibly anism : rec@@ laim@@ ing : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that constitute the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures because I exist in this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; due to my dark skin and my being , I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor declined . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special request through Kur@@ dist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community . &quot;
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq , a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , who uses and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on traced , little notable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which aid oppressed communities can tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; crying women &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and show their rejection .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people affected .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s well @-@ informed indication was nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved back to her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; in general , if women give notice at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , report to the prosecution authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ kes and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system , that nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to see how many women really are being mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ ms , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the available numbers are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements were issued by the District Prosecutor &apos;s Office for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads used by the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of the ads of women came here . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded due to physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own crime , prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay die due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then gave up . this should always repent . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had missed the so long time of Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least some kind of complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victori@@ as &apos;s case everything started with mental ill @-@ treatment .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly concerned with money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the indication of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Lux@@ e ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Ali@@ gn@@ ess ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ inists have to declare to an independent criminal offen@@ se and to punish those who are already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus the wording of the law was changed in some points , in order to also gain the de@@ pu@@ ties of the law , which feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay , is to be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill intended to pay the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence have to carry on themselves , if they just want to provide evidence and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , ill @-@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are punished . &quot;
we must provide such a long @-@ term ad until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered . &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
the passage concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media continues to be subjected to attacks one year after a newspaper ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the basis of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arabic language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is serving a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had abandoned his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has been suffering the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Command of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the central bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially of inland secret services , public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , restric@@ ting and tor@@ turing human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after an article titled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties joining hands of justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance conflict . &quot;
&quot; issue of Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of justice &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , ISS seized the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was concluded at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ k@@ at . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , inter alia , because of the distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 Cuban Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was found guilty of a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set , and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Appe@@ al pronounced Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison where he is serving his one @-@ year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to exclude the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the Court &apos;s decision to release Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper continues to face attacks by the Cuban government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister ordered another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the following authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation that supports human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and protect them peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown with its approval &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare system , covering the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have a far more serious impact in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in research these diseases through pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists will help to establish their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impacts on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ do@@ c at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier is a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always stay tuned , rather than being a creator . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are conveyed in different ways .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , as funding and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines only make articles accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of salad he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
&quot; the patents are not only for single varieties but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , special red@@ - or green @-@ tone or cro@@ ch@@ eted leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on species . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but it takes longer since his work is becoming more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to d@@ ull .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the growing tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features have already been patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ our@@ ing to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ din variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the schol@@ arly professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; he says and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as is , for example , on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened . &quot;
&quot; food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to keep their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to patent seeds and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has dealt with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability in her PhD thesis . she found out that about a third of all car@@ rots features are protected as intellectual property , so that it can be used for plant breeders at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are still patented as a salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of perspective
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - of such , by which their taste or color will improve up to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the plant material available for breeders is increasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are far worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property must include other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but fo@@ sters them by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires and certainly does not promote innovation .
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you should have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us forward , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; all in all , Mort@@ on is interfer@@ ing with the concept to patent crop characteristics : &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds also its own values in it . &quot;
&quot; for those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , they breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that breeders are more innovative because of avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I always need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which one makes it very simple in my opinion . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ e works on an &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a form@@ less and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i commitment is not simply one to become one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , states that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems to be the official starting signal for the planned next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others , published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above . &quot;
&quot; in August the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities for this step strongly critic@@ ised and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ble@@ - despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , has never been as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog to spread columns and articles , which he writes for non @-@ accessible web pages and media for Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , which is also home to Canada &apos;s blog , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity since he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to lock blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; it has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a siege condition ; An arrest , an attempted murder , charging at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courage@@ ous go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of vendors , possible by b@@ yp@@ assing Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
A@@ w@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offered by V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; in addition , the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , thus eliminating the legal basis for the Egyptian people , by means of which they can proceed in court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants fight .
&quot; the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; newspapers throughout Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed dru@@ g@@ stores with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ ship to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violent wave of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; newspaper , known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new category called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision stated the paper in such a way :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual abuse , etc . everything , which however devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , will be published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ ede@@ an , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 fields controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the paper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to ret@@ ou@@ ch the atro@@ cities of the police , who are only shooting and then asking questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues against violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it showed in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; in memory , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to statistics from 2015 . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates a federal state , Rio lays down on No@@ .@@ 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; specially owned by the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) . &quot;
&quot; for some years , however , after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , the U@@ PP is increasingly under fire . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this involves entering the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
war on or off is the fact that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
&quot; one week later , the police cl@@ apped the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ z@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre by the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel areas have been under siege by rebel areas outside Damascus , which led inhabitants to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been struggling to make this project known and expressed his relief that it gains more and more &quot; fame . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have achieved more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the greenhouse scar@@ city , locally produced fuels are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began the &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a bigger basin . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free . &quot;
Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires which were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured because of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also recorded in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there have been more than 500 out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , in 2017 alone in Portugal approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some pictures shared by Twitter users :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity from case to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread on fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems add that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when citizens were looking for information or trying to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the server did not stand the rush of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the G@@ haz@@ ni province in central Afghanistan last time together with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the dawn , the boy should break . &quot;
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly feeling defen@@ sel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ f found herself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the job was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ f rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an abandoned building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no service there and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ f left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ f came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ f &apos;s homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided meals to aid patients twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high funding rates , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
&quot; so , there was also A@@ shar@@ f . &quot;
but his un@@ restra@@ ined disposition helped A@@ shar@@ f to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having made various works in the construction sector for several years , A@@ shar@@ f put its entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ f Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of them have been created by Afgh@@ ans , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ f also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ f has made this trip itself . now , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : legal dra@@ fts from Egypt allow dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in detention for more than 900 days . &quot;
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo which prot@@ ested against the de@@ mis@@ sal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
&quot; users must register in order to be able to use the social networks , register within six months after successful bill of law on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or the tri@@ ple@@ tion of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Parliament adopted a proposal to introduce the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high official . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ ting of the President as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the legislative proposal , such a deed would be punished with jail and fin@@ es , according to legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger anyway for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; like more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in prison for a court appointment . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison administration according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is facing the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ pollution of e.g. weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a cleared the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ el Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si place block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
listening to Tunisi@@ an activists on in@@ gest@@ ed documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been inter@@ ro@@ gated to a dedicated plan of action . said plan is provided by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly endor@@ ses a controversial draft law , which would assure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they all return un@@ lawful mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , published on the 21st of April , sheds light on how the pre @-@ winning plans to support the legislation will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which journalists affir@@ med the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 9 May . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to the new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need approval before writing or sharing messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts assume that this will mean the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then let &apos;s see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , Russia &apos;s state cens@@ orship blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat rev@@ oked to register with the provincial government as the &quot; organis@@ er of the dissemination of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government is carrying out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to provide said services for the removal of content and to force it upon request for the disclosure of user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages currently include web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ stal@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has lock Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site had been blocked because it led to &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to promote a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff out
&quot; following this week @-@ fed documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install back@@ pack@@ ers , de@@ cip@@ her@@ ing data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
