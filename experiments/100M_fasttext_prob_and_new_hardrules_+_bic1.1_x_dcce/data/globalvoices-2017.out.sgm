<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American writers and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican's letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to appeal to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain, as it is said so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmericans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number, ever reaching a candidate nominated by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism program, who takes people from all over the world, a deeply disbeliever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps Weltanschauung, too, did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, who helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values incarnated by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump was making its way to the nominations of Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as shakers.</seg>
<seg id="34">"assigning people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country they have disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(note): as much as" "leaning the whites against all other ethnicities"; word play from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means as much as the Great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has made so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge portion of the white American promise of this promise, saying," Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd responded with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd was roaring.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices became louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is Trumps Land now, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music played in both places has not only changed the children's lives, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now La banda de MÃºsica (music band) plays in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest to the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the commune, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with restored instruments composed of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violin, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsal and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made up of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of garbage each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest ones - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known back then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a perpetrator of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to take one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything", "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority, is a member of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it did not succeed in catching fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for the looting of the fish stocks in the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the premier out of their waters back then."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, which is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions are now happening in real time, traceable at the FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activity or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible for authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered, such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a penal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay sanctions, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm which advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $20 million of lost revenue, which will lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen who enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include such actions as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of fantasies, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they purposefully use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-unbroken control system, "says Long." earlier a ship could fishing illegally and a country could then say "You're not able to run my harbour." "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and just this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had dispersed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered from satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"for this reason, Copeland is helping to build a system that combines different information levels. FISH-i should help to find criminally acting vessels with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously fished without a license and hardly expected consequences will now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile reported a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses since then."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually due to illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined together, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With security the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used towing nets that are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="226">"on the base of the military, I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners."</seg>

<seg id="229">"the prisoners are tortured" ""</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack in which cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - everything was possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I looked inside and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">The other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, overshot him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 Volts in the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty winch.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forgot this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible for a man to do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and wore hands."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people were silent on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you come up with me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me of it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms have been designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know "Palito" Romero put together a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera trial, charges the student RaÃºl Mateo Molina (death)."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla Memorial, goes through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came here is also the way on which the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the order came from above that they should be misplaced."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War of War'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "war of war" - as they knew - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was at the military later, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet or perhaps military insignia which one takes on an enemy that is fought against."</seg>

<seg id="273">"but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator, the record player, clothing, painting, money... steals, this is not a war of war, but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the head of security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered: and you, who steal cars on the street?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with anger, struck me and screamed:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"when you go so far, I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">"for this, we need no one else!"</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"as I said in the process, I showed a photograph from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll-collar sweater made of wool. both of them had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes to his home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay my burden on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I get older, I feel regret."</seg>
<seg id="292">"when you first have children, you recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, so you executed people during the dictatorship. but why did the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children are kidnapped?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom one could pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act that can be done to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." "you will never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But of course something always remains.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I just told the truth about 20 criminals, including my father."</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought to display my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the atrocities I had to witness.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," I don't know. I didn't kill anyone. ""</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked myself why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" "Western and Christian feelings" "they allegedly defended were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You committed horrible crimes and you forced me as a child to take part in it.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he replied," "Well, then show me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">This is exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I posted the first advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="322">I had finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can reproach me that I am prejudiced. I finally declared against my own father.</seg>
<seg id="324">Luis Alberto Quijano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial.</seg>

<seg id="345">The photo was spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving license, in the last month witnesses of a particularly unsuccessful translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a sign the Japanese word, the" "older motorists" ", was falsely mistaken - but perhaps also with evil hindsight & # 8212; being translated as" awful motorists. ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Joshua Levine's original photos shared in many social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he also paid attention to the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The newspaper Kyoto Shimbun's published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto, simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the name" "terrible drivers" "(german:" "terrible motorists" ") was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite proper name" "elder drivers" "(German:" "older motorists" ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text that they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger wrote about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that older people felt offended by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News was more detailed with the phenomenon of the "awful" elderly motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awful "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are involved in accidents across the country is also a cause for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by senior citizens increased in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"in the published version of the article, the unnamed reporter published comments on the light which show what prejudices some Japanese have apparently leaned against older motorists:"</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation error received among other things the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrible motorists ") about not reality?</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" "How accurate is the translation not at all, isn't it?" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to transmit active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"a French native speaker, for example, should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translating, cost-reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can nevertheless make translations company-internal. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is assessed as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the verbalized and enigmatic sentences, produced by machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints which often adorn t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"she said," "she said," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began working as a criolta for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money surpasses their underage son or their underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay for countless days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty which cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, known as Criadazgo, is widely used in Paraguay as a result of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimony, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the Crimean Delta is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who has her daughter in the belief that she can finish her training, improve her position in society and" "make something out of herself" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl with her and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will experience only many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon occurred in the secrecy in Paraguayan households, but a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly after she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was in the household of the former military family TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who acts as an official in the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira defeated MarÃ­n as long as it suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cries.</seg>
<seg id="444">"organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela, who were deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society, were responsible for the death of the girl."</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest meetings and demanded that "no further Carolina" can occur in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows than children are registered in Paraguay," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl, who was her Criticta."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n might be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay, a case of Criadazgo comes to court."</seg>

<seg id="457">"her brothers now had to work all the time, and began selling candy on the street or on the market in order to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital AsunciÃ³n in Crimean City.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, they clean the fridge, clean the living room, polished the furniture and infected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently voted for a bill to "regulate the use and usage of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if accepted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established in order to give citizens a permit to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and cursed in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as a" jedwede application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice, video news and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. it is unclear how the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament's deputy and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt plans to build a firewall on the national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" conducting research technologist ") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they are forced by violent public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, this means that they will set up a strong monitoring system in order to filter citizens who apply for approval or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to lead them to a court case."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative Parliament and the constitutional Committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its adoption and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military thought in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface," "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, Tamer El-ShaFishery decreed a bill against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence was foreseen for those who are found guilty of" threatening public order "and" to protest. ""</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the greater family of Leopards, who wiped through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals, thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video suggests that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera-all, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress that had been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple disaster "in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was an important prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring islands Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to this, the Fukushima prefecture experienced an atomic accident, even for that reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress six years later were achieved to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as poll results of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement buildings (the company, the company, saigai kouei jute jute) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima constitutes 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, six years after the disaster, the evacuated of lodging establishments (the company, the company, Kazetsu jute aku) were still trying to relocate to final replacement buildings."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 are still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people who were living in shelters after the disaster were resettled into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by accident, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures of agrarian land, the tsunami and the atomic accident have suffered enormously in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the" nuclear interlock zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far beaten."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same booth as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe, almost half of the coastal population, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough has been done in disasters prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">What about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also focused on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture witnessed the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled to permanent replacement buildings."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima out of their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas, most of the evacuated people who are still living in lodging establishments are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the fall, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its assets, until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>

<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity."</seg>
<seg id="639">"a few decades ago, the news would have been a motive for concern for the country, but the bad harvests are no more news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>

<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the comminution of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, a part of the N'we Jinan-Tour brings workshops and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in North Quebec together with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northern Stars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in talks like" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever they find in the sense."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal area of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section called Westkanada, where nearly two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs in spite of the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-group, who gave them a stopper in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "plastic models of the dishes" ") are issued by any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappa, there are a large number of small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend today turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new plastic straps decorated with plastic ribbons as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new Boom of Essentials is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an Imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phones:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the cell phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the communities who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with the drug trade "), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people involved in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and so entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something such simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches secret tombs after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father only one day, lost her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we are preparing again for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta said: "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need education."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me as well."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't get them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where shall we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a Lesess of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they walk through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" receptive. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the city district: how a family was plundered by threats. "in it, she describes how armed detective month paid money from their business until they end up destroying the business, but also tore their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never fades, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers also."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as you do not know when to kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in those fearful days I wondered if crying would dissolve my deep-rooted emotions, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation committed by violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, make tortillas warm and" "chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had passed two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as a force mastered by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office had 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 Mordes per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "animal PolÃ­tico launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trafficking that has tortured the country over the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been used in a misleading way to see tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false pairing of picture and event -" wrong description "or" false context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tanker traversed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, dumped and exploded. 230 people lost their lives."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for many years and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths filled with potholes, which were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank truck fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a cinemas in the vicinity, which was full of people who looked at the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and stolen corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" This is Nigeria. "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charcoal bodies lying on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was erased several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to actual tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, combatants of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "said a resident to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be pictorially displayed."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR Congo showed up again when it was mistakenly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of misdescriptions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example wrongly reflect the DR Congo image with sources of mass media to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash message, published by the United Nations described the ones who could flee from blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared as the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="912">"this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the Catholic nearby AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims that there is a" similar jihadist attack. ""</seg>
<seg id="913">"when the picture was circulated later in the context of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015, the El Pais newspaper tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="914">"Turkey, 2015." # NijeryaYanÄ±yorDÃ¼nyaUyuy "(Nigeria is burning, the world sleeps)."</seg>
<seg id="915">"the DR Congo image picks up with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris."</seg>
<seg id="916">"they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events, which allegedly took place in the name of Islam."</seg>
<seg id="917">"United States, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="918">"the picture was weathered as proof of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context."</seg>
<seg id="919">"instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014."</seg>
<seg id="921">"after a message allegedly written by a" "father Juan Carlos Martos" "about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnamese and declared it a false report."</seg>
<seg id="922">"from the message in which the image was contained in the DR Congo, the organization of the Claretinaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos distanced themselves."</seg>
<seg id="923">"there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pull through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are umpteen people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of forcible images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, there is a concern that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitizing and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study investigating how violent media act to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake news". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from context or completely abusive way."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, each study of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog called untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) tries to offer voice enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they express certain situations or feelings often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">"some of these insurmountable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others, deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sobmesa)."</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone is stubbornly resisting any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists handle Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of" untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the imprint language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" "- Take care of your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years."</seg>
<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi - The comfort or laziness that you feel after you have been warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these" insurmountable "words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are."</seg>

<seg id="1001">"my girlfriend watches me and says," "These things do not concern you, or?" "why, because I am not a Muslim?" "I ask."</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">"people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar, who know them - from the widespread concept of" Muslims, "which has built up in their imagination."</seg>
<seg id="1004">They are mitigating me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"we identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow, all of us are put into the same Muslim drawer."</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit in as I do not fit into it.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Need to be relieved</seg>
<seg id="1011">I am not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">"this is even the poet, whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi."</seg>

<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">"when Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I was now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died, the centre of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"but in the Western vision the religion of Rumis was erased, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists in the reductionist images of Muslims that have been colonializing Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said destroyed the story behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>

<seg id="1024">"our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpetuate them."</seg>
<seg id="1025">"I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years, and I have seen how these powerful, flawed narrations dominate our news feeds."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"this narrative overshadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades, while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"this narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forced Saudi Arabian, Muslim women to cover their entire body, both sides are both sides of the same coin."</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exerts its "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narration weakens Muslim women who lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">"it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim Prayers have been spoken by Africans, who were brought here with slave ships."</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and flawed that often Sikh men and children become the goal of anti-anti attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">"because of these stories we tell, and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of" others. ""</seg>

<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk of small and not quite as small languages will not be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening to it is often associated with understanding," these events instead "listen to, to appreciate, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers can first translate and translate their story in their own language, or then explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation make it possible for the audience to listen to them."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cause laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamara tells the fables of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his Fabel, John Nyamara is asked:" how is it to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a broad grin, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and organizers hope to extend this. anyone inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story talks."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started with the Mexican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the replacement of debts have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos calls for politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without personal interest in public debts, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of citizens, imposed measures will be at risk of being rejected by the people."</seg>
<seg id="1171">"the demonstration carried the name" "night watch for light and truth." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">"this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to the # Freebassel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, published excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the real cost associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat in on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice, who are pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activities has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, was transferred to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his place of residence and state remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently passes the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes were more prescient than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of many civilisations and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in detention."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a prozema, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 to her husband when he was in detention."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated them into English from Arabic."</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is freely available.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>

<seg id="1229">"that I sunk in the world of your enchanting eyes,"</seg>
<seg id="1230">"that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that I don't care for any of the dangers,"</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and guards"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the throng of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I go into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">"which I carry with passion with me,"</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will let another piece of my soul be with you...</seg>

<seg id="1239">"to reclaim all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">"on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="1243">"a year goes by, my soul"</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case, where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his imprisonment on which the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council has ruled Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately requested his reposition to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old posts, as the company did not pursue a disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many residents do not say the action is good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, seems to be silent and does not induce reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"egÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosaic social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "contradictory" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of them had dropped off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could consult and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped cause harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have any morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has already massively insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing to return morals and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself in the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre-charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally use as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or, as part of an initiative, to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "Kalar" may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech. "</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitters), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "Healing" "(ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hook believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before killing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism doesn't understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, carefully analyze and control the mail by checking the words next to them."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitters).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, spreading hate speech, have received quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who is spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of censored words to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook Guideline, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to upload, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post" didn't meet Facebook community standards. ""</seg>

<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "chair" "or" "peas curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fake posts."</seg>

<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in the sand.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to ban this practice so that the age-related age is now 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"before this change of marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities held in practice, and in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, since that, at age, does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children's Rights Convention, the Minors as,, every person under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were already married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the statistical office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were anxious to abolish laws for child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say to the critics of the children's marriage, they should, be damned about their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill against child marriage was decided - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">"now, only the president of the country has to approve and announce the law."</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook which once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one against it was decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become the law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for child marriage had finally been changed.</seg>

<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the Interplanetary File System), as the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around her. they were blurry with badly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"his hometown, next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just looked at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) suddenly called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti River would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was on and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar aspires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature, and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, because he was already facing Tigers face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot interfere with the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"I too was home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should abuse the norm to preserve this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by an Appeal Court and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married couple with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of calling her wives apart from the name is also common among men. however, they have far less permission to fear, if at all, they should not come after this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel and housewives, entered a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the coverage of practices, such as children's marriage to exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and directs these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was about women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to talk about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands is a custom that they are all guilty of and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name so far, wanted to try at home as it is going on."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some thought it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get into motion the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they all asked," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she would just chick herself during the whole exercise; another decided to let the whole famed frustration go out against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in an adrenalin rush about having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as carrying the zinced red dot on the forehead, indicating the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinced point if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear something," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say things loudly, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them are okay, but some wanted a sage-curta, a wide shirt over a pants, wear; they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohggled Rohini gave her own pair of short deltas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided to take a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club had already changed, Rohini confirmed that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women rehearsed it a few times, but then they stopped saying the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling around more freedom of movement or their own clothes choice - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we're talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages from those who experience it themselves, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1630">"in 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years" imprisonment for "Subversion" (state risk), having participated in the draft of the 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China. "</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal matter" "and told a spokesman, he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China will continue to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's premier Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>

<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that is, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' in view of it, it inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the topic, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised corresponding questions with the non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to show his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon published his comment on the blog, he points out the criticism that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities were seeing a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said," "Don't be a country," "he obviously did not mean it in that sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes this and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "belive a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, will we only be seen as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since it plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore pay their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have angered many Singaporeans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, especially "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak more about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked me in Japan is: "are you an American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry, I'll answer." I come from Canada. "since 1994, I live in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversational partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification follows usually the standard response:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, Nature. "many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly before anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know each other, there is little difference to Canadians of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried little maple leaves on their bags to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>

<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "apology."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country for ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"it wouldn't matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas, for example."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first of all, being called" nice "means being spiny - just like the benign, gentle, but tragically insignificant silhouette of Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has one's own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being inconspicuous and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go so far, to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major feature of the Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open kindness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video that parounces the junta, which took power in 2014 and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the precepts about his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not specifically political, the music video indirectly refers to the continuing military rule of the Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"within the first three days, the video uploaded on Facebook alone was 1.254 times and received 8,800 songs."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" "The dictator" "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly in relation to the situation of the country under the junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos which relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision-making over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th Rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious programme for" setting up "journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people considered by the Junta as a critic."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army, supervised on online content and persons accused of being persecuted by the monarchy, prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand relies on a strikered face against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic flights).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">"two days later, it came to a coup d" Ã©tat. "</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black vans before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society, and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser of the song became members of the band who imitated the Salut from" The Tribute of Panem, "which was already used by Putin's opponents during the protests in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in Teddy Bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, brittle walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez relates, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy medication they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurtarian) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then go northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Africans often travel along the circuit and that Africans have already talked to Whatsapp from Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mum Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send text messages when they went to greet them or to tell her about the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"MS RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cookery place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single instructor, offered him the roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next steps."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, the travellers always consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"MS RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves with numerous photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair weaving she has made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she imagines her shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeated every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" "preventing access to terrorist information". ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had messages exchanged with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app was informed that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans, and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these features can be used in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while notions of digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet" Images from mainland China "published on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen checked the inhabitants randomly to see if they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" ("Popular Educational Buildings,") also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can uplift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities, and the party associated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi in order to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumblis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a number of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1995">"far away from our blue, virtual world, you look at you and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important."</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognisable both inside and outside.</seg>

<seg id="1998">One who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that don't allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when reality brings you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even when Earth is spinning on the axis of evil. you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone for stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to" learn my lesson, "as the chief of the Security Service expressed it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were ripped during a peaceful protest like weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with "Allahu akbar" cries.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the districts of the city sought, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that is stuffed up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night things had calmed down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by shouting "Allahu akbar" several times from my home roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice befallen by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt bold enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we joined a magnificent picture that filled my expectations full and completely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you are aware that you are releasing the Spirit out of the lamp, but it simply does not interest you in the slightest."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you your voice, after you have screamed them all the way to the office of security service."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I came there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the colonel of Ghassan begins to speak:" let me also hear how you cry "Allahu akbar," or you are brave enough to scream, if we are not near. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes were on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you're really grieving what to look into my eyes and not on the floor!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity, perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">"I was so sure of my cause, when I answered:" "I wouldn't have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday."</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father equally with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father, right with it."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence is up to now in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a mental torture that I had been exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I preside all the details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"unlike anything else, this time they have assigned me a larger cell."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one prisoner, and I must immediately put myself in place without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the civil servant left the cell, and I went back to a tried-and-tested method of communication: hitting the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell was a" "first" "inmate."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently, in none of the surrounding cells there was a well-known middle-aged man who looks similar to me and called" "the doctor". ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in the perfect darkness there are no distinctive facial features, and doctors don't have it here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>

<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cries, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black is the color of perdition until I saw the yellow light that presented us horror in person: the wheel (about:" thunder, "allusion to the thirteenth Sure of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was revealed: to protect the security against us and to prevent us from releasing the traitor and terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their denominational blackmail and betrayed the close view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, which is not a country here; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clans into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me so."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he catches a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that derail him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"I have used it to myself, not to answer."</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to punishment, although I had nothing done to deserve this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">In punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold back your cries."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cries were not enough to him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator had previously worked as a collector of rubbish or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour, three of them changed, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped shouting."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and didn't find any favors at all, so he grabbed as the next to an electrically charged rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body, stretched out on the floor, was the perfect conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours passed, which occurred to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light meets the space." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spend most of his time indoors, sometimes he hurls to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as feliyeen (about: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks its well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and according to his own statement, he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he harbors a special reluctance to American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib contemplates his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation "- so he describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so, because of my own living circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while in water, NescafÃ© shook in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slugs speak fluffy coffee and the rakes of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic campaign - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the MP and former spokesman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said that the concert was" straight "cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which asks the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to advocate intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be just shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflected a clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib drew up traditional gender norms by creating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently dusty unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'Honorary Citizens' - the inofficial outwardly."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still startling that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in appropriate ways."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to fight crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be kept in prison for indefinite time", "and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from topics that are long as taboos in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate from politics his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics have been richly worsened", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed", "Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled" "Santandano". ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words," get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later point out that his comments were torn from the context, distorted and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts but only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still today thanks to his homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who was supposed to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemite realm, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association, with the grounds that they had critical comments on social media comments related to the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's what Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approaching a real and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to drag and resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman listened to as a student Fellow."</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the feats, drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and from a period of time when armies of West Japan invaded the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissaries, to their knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to snap some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed trucks are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outer appearances and personal care have rarely been as important as in this history, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which took place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there, experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"education institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressers instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year starting in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of her successes:"</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: securitisation letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel expelled to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this was precisely the question of the young Columbian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired her to the Carta por la JliaciÃ³n campaign (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla force of FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), forming the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was as significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, subjected to war rhetoric and carrying out their arms round the clock, must now return to life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now assimilate them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need much more needful."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent appeal."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never have thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the Bogotart Foundation, travelled to the camps to personally persuade the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept orders from their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "said the policy-based student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Camden" "(a kind of cottage in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL guard, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty of Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he answered," "Hi, what do they just do?" "he said," "I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state exerted itself on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to make society more just in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who have never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people whom I have often seen as monsters and even hate them, are just people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men, including those who killed and so much hurt, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp commandant in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons, protest and protest for their rights, and this is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community is not made overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that addressed the abduction, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in gun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since childhood she felt she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced the sex balance of their Landsman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she moved to the USA in the final analysis."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no men in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents went through the whole WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just going to fetch some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you want to dishonour the family, you cheek? ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and began to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which cases were you laid, in which of the men or the women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name still stands on it, but the doctor understood and laid me down to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked me to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they presented absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running on top without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender, that everything was only bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering with me, without ID, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message:" you don't believe you're safe, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the sex equation, that's a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this mental barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really take effort to look at the person they remember from their past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for this, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had been in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he said that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut down a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still locked in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: an acquaintance of mine says there were not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to establish Kadyrows's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people had not just vanished, but specifically submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports on that yet. we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grosny when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was applied, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us closer to" "civilizing", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Sharia has never even curved my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say it to children when they laugh at the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morals on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who smiled and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize tea retreats, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food types."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I cut off the influenza variety.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature is, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you sweat in front of your mouth, that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the rooters have which, the Kabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear this."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transistence for men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be exact, different attitudes of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 repressed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness that could arise for his family, so Ahwazi's human rights groups who wish to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazazwi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed this month."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patrons, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to contend their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and privation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi-Arabs working in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawtsyoung people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Manager for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahrazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed secondary school and 45% have completed a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "led to a" high increase "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahraz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland, Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first name and surname in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to be employed, as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances given by the Arab Ahrazi, human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I don't identify with feminism even with the intersectional</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women - call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and societal arguments about why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, in spite of equal education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still attracting across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I suffer double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: if I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial separation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift their voices up" "and" "Kumbaya, my Lord", "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence, which we are subjected to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman is standing, who refuses to take into account inequalities in her mind, which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner complained in his speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanized and marginalised being in a historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, who also absorb our customs and customs by means of cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"some of them will continue to silence the meaning of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to instruct them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and narrow down from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to dissolve myself completely from feminism and join the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than advocating for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana possibly anism: reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that constitute the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures because I exist in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"due to my dark skin and my being, I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor declined."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published in Ensia.com, a magazine, which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again, Nabil Musa traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special request through Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of Waterkeepers Iraq, a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, who uses and works to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in one question:" if we had no more water, how would we survive? ""</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is on traced, little notable subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperatively videography and new multimedia techniques, with which aid oppressed communities can tell their stories in their way."</seg>

<seg id="2478">A group of women portrays "crying women" to express their pain on women's morals in the country and in the region and show their rejection.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# soflicheinefraubin) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar told Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman Balbuena showed for abuse, Ada BÃ¡ez's well-informed indication was nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved back to her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"in general, if women give notice at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, report to the prosecution authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strikes and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system, that nothing undernimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to see how many women really are being mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Ems, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the available numbers are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 advertisements were issued by the District Prosecutor's Office for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads used by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, too, 86% of the ads of women came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman who is refunded due to physical abuse, two women who do not do so," "she declared at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own crime, prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay die due to violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign with the inscription:" "without complicity, no impunity." "photo by Jessie Insfran PÃ©rez. use with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she didn't want to do it, but then gave up. this should always repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are to be subservient because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had missed the so long time of Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least some kind of complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner abused her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" "I believe you" "), which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias's case everything started with mental ill-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an impenetrable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly concerned with money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay's laws: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>

<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# Luxe)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Aligness) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that feminists have to declare to an independent criminal offense and to punish those who are already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus the wording of the law was changed in some points, in order to also gain the deputies of the law, which feared that the road to decriminalize abortions, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay, is to be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill intended to pay the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence have to carry on themselves, if they just want to provide evidence and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, ill-treatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethink must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are punished."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must provide such a long-term ad until maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown with its approval"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare system, covering the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a far more serious impact in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment in research these diseases through pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists will help to establish their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impacts on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier is a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always stay tuned, rather than being a creator."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are conveyed in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here, as funding and development chances are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">How is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines only make articles accessible for payment (the so-called Paywall), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of salad he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for single varieties but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, special red- or green-tone or crocheted leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carton species."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but it takes longer since his work is becoming more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to dull.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the growing tradition," he says. "I think these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features have already been patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavouring to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the Outreddin variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the scholarly professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds, "he says and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, as is, for example, on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to keep their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patent seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has dealt with genetic variation in carrots and their availability in her PhD thesis. she found out that about a third of all carrots features are protected as intellectual property, so that it can be used for plant breeders at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are still patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - of such, by which their taste or color will improve up to such, because they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the plant material available for breeders is increasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are far worse due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property must include other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but fosters them by providing the public with more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires and certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you should have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain:" independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us forward, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"all in all, Morton is interfering with the concept to patent crop characteristics:" "we do not really create the features ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" he who breeds a variety breeds also its own values in it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"for those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation mass-wise herbicides are needed, they breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders are more innovative because of avoiding plant patents:" it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I always need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years", "he says." "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, with which one makes it very simple in my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agree works on an" "open-source" "license which is ultimately a formless and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi commitment is not simply one to become one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's" Open Source "seed systems, states that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems to be the official starting signal for the planned next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others, published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that the Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities for this step strongly criticised and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ble- despite this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, has never been as important as now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based Al Jazeera network because of alleged" support for terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ziada used his blog to spread columns and articles, which he writes for non-accessible web pages and media for Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, which is also home to Canada's blog, on the other hand, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity since he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to lock blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi's priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"it has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a siege condition; An arrest, an attempted murder, charging at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"afte also documented the blockage of vendors, possible by bypassing Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Awte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offered by VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, thus eliminating the legal basis for the Egyptian people, by means of which they can proceed in court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the Brazilian army was deployed in the favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis."</seg>

<seg id="2753">"newspapers throughout Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves robbed drugstores with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airship to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violent wave of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the newspaper" Extra "newspaper, known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August, published the editorial" This is not normal, "in which she announced to set up a new category called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision stated the paper in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual abuse, etc. everything, which however deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, will be published in the category" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedean, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 fields controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the paper writes on:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to retouch the atrocities of the police, who are only shooting and then asking questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues against violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it showed in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"in memory, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north-east of the country according to statistics from 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2781">"the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003, also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora)."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"for some years, however, after several reports of harassment and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, the UPP is increasingly under fire."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, explaining why violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"for this involves entering the territory of a" enemy, "where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" lost bullets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">War on or off is the fact that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">"one week later, the police clapped the mountain with the favela Jacarezho to avenge the death of a policeman."</seg>
<seg id="2789">"in the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre by the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel areas have been under siege by rebel areas outside Damascus, which led inhabitants to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the director of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years he has been struggling to make this project known and expressed his relief that it gains more and more" fame. ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, so Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have achieved more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations on Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the greenhouse scarcity, locally produced fuels are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began the" production of mushrooms from the regions, "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom-yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a bigger basin. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta for free."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires which were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured because of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also recorded in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there have been more than 500 outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, in 2017 alone in Portugal approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">"all of Portugal is burning in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata, (@ a _ ataner) October 15, 2017"</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral from the federal government of Portugal declared the PÃºblico newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after PedrÃ³gÃ£o, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened as in June, as the roads were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed the construction activity from case to fall if the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," JoÃ£o Sorval continues in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus drew attention to the fact that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, spread on fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems add that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when citizens were looking for information or trying to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the server did not stand the rush of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groups which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharf found herself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the job was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his little wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars who were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by poverty and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an abandoned building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there was no service there and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharf left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time was Asharf's homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that divided meals to aid patients twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high funding rates, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"so, there was also Asharf."</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained disposition helped Asharf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having made various works in the construction sector for several years, Asharf put its entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to the official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years some of them have been created by Afghans, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts."</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"however, Asharafs aims far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>

<seg id="2925">"Asharf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "so they can sell their crop surplus in the market and improve their financial situation," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there are stability and prosperity."</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">"users must register in order to be able to use the social networks, register within six months after successful bill of law on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or the tripletion of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of the Parliament adopted a proposal to introduce the tougher penalties for the insult of the president or a high official."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under Egyptian law, the insulting of the President as well as state institutions is already punishable. under the legislative proposal, such a deed would be punished with jail and fines, according to legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger anyway for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"like more than 700 protesters who had been arrested at the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in prison for a court appointment."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed on 20 May, because the prison administration according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is facing the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-pollution of e.g. weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal court in Giza cleared the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosel Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi place blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Listening to Tunisian activists on ingested documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia has mainly been interrogated to a dedicated plan of action. said plan is provided by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly endorses a controversial draft law, which would assure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that they all return unlawful monies."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on the Nawaat website, published on the 21st of April, sheds light on how the pre-winning plans to support the legislation will look like."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia rejected the nomination of his sources, stating article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists affirmed the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 9 May."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to the new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need approval before writing or sharing messages in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in the rules, it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required."</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will mean the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
