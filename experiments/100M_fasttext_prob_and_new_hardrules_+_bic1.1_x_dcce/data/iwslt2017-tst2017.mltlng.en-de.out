that is James Ris@@ en .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally ab@@ dic@@ ated tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in it , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA handed over blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has declared against Ris@@ en and promp@@ ts him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courage@@ ous they reveal .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked on ris@@ ings , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had years of indication that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to tears . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of spl@@ itting and spl@@ itting up , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly concerned his phone calls , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit , and even travel references with the list of flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s presum@@ ed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional allowance , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that did not yet exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source surveillance system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet world famous by us , Swar@@ tz , and has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload or send documents , just like any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole , in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to do mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for poll@@ uted waters of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street In@@ sider , who warned us about the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like the Fon@@ sec@@ a Mos@@ que and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion is leading to Russian President Vladimir Putin , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting for the next release , and on the next unveiled documents . &quot;
now it sounds like an agent &apos;s plot or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years now . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a mattress soup .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is the case . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; probably because there were no prominent Americans , who came in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ ruck@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is true that in some U.S. countries , less information is needed , less information needs to be given to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to pick up particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave herself as afri@@ can minister , who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked all of us that all the way to a lawyer our investig@@ ator made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers accepted us as clients and of course nobody was handed over to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single top politi@@ cian who is embro@@ iled in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult .
&quot; this may sound very sad as if we could do nothing about it , as if nothing had ever changed , as if there were always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress which we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
&quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this kind of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the transparency which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made an outlet sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Ah , please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ? &quot;
a wild stranger is sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ out on toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
it was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people , who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment will be a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ cheese tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came in roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; this is how we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room their doors are closed when visit is over . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite other people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
&quot; however , they do not . &quot;
&quot; nobody , who is still with con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you should focus on the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design do anything like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this silent flight of panic that you are feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
most of the guests feel like they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 opinions which all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens the trust .
&quot; in the beginning , we did some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
we have little surprise to the people who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation ear@@ ns com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you are revealing . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m making a vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can it be created with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company relies on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need which was previously not covered .
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to be celebrated or apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction . &quot;
for people have trusted each other .
&quot; if trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can emerge . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgement :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay is going on . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing coinci@@ de with money transactions ?
it is a commercial trade .
&quot; but it is now simply &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; &quot; to name , the thing is not fair . &quot;
share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , you can compare it with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if journeys were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood that you never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , rather than isolation and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that the government belonged to , &quot;
&quot; students , who were looking for a place to stay , were offered . &quot;
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . In@@ cub@@ ator programmes were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . today , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also a warm hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that one can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay with the check check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
&quot; presumably , people do not talk to their competitors . &quot;
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a car@@ c@@ aker &apos;s fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I was not born like that . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , I thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was faith and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; Eil@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should we do this ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; In the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , &quot; ... &quot; bomb Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I felt the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment this night , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; and again the warning : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que might be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or from people that were held for Muslims , in the open , and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we release them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques become safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking places free of charge , but do not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more tolerant people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as I recently told me , a leader of the police in Washington , DC : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radic@@ alisation , one has found that he begins on @-@ line . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their families so that the extreme group believes that terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or ab@@ used by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imag@@ inations , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity . &quot;
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you look at them , they do not cast what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their fur@@ y , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m re@@ marked the connection with God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our liberty of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that when we fear we happen at least three things .
&quot; we tend to accept an authorit@@ arian government system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if people submit messages in which negative reports were reported about Muslims , they were more involved in military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood hits Muslims up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about being able to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the Faculty of The@@ ology , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was astonished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such a young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who visited her in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , work in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest study on Muslims all over the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if humans appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a hob@@ by@@ ist , is about to become a multi @-@ billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutes all over the world . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ packages came into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ load@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and in general react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively where mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new localization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available in the highest image e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight unit that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ g@@ ler , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ red wings , it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind bows .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts coming together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ ic , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight unit . it was invented short before . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much , so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right when everyone is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the monster is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , it receives the au@@ sp@@ icious capability , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly while flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at this .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise direction .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , albeit limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a pallet of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took common micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there on Broadway wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
&quot; for types like us , the reward lies in the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cled each other in a very distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second turned into pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment they ligh@@ tened bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in a timely manner .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , there has been mass life on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courage@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last trial to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes moved through the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , it was the fruits of my life &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied gravit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . what are gravit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gravit@@ ational @-@ wave is a c@@ row in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ ole into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ating , lec@@ turers often perform a really stupid dance in courses related to the theory of rel@@ ativity . &quot;
&quot; stretch and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and breath@@ ed by us when the waves were hit . average man &apos;s el@@ ong@@ ation was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is to say 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o staff explained to me crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by watching the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sounds , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain features such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we can &apos;t make simple images of objects in space .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the All speaking . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of noise &#93; Som@@ ebody knows what to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the bars of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let us consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the all and hear the un@@ seen .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them from them .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because these op@@ a@@ os are .
&quot; gravit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own light @-@ light . &quot;
&quot; using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that all things exist which we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we had not expected . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the League project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different angle of view on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to everything I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am the author . I think things out , bring you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ amed TV . I &apos;m producing television .
&quot; I &apos;m doing television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days , four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , all around the world burning . &quot;
do you know who you are doing ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand it &apos;s dre@@ aming about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m en@@ gros@@ sed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
&quot; it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as long as you wear a high tone , run a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sw@@ um sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on her . &quot;
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is a pleasure to me .
&quot; don &apos;t you understand me wrong , you do it . &quot;
&quot; but the h@@ um -- when I started television production when I began working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sw@@ um is action and activity . the sw@@ um is a drug .
the sums are music . the sw@@ um is light and air .
the tot@@ ality is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you can no longer strive for size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being different to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sums .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it means genius .
perhaps it says ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know I &apos;m not going to fail , and I just know that I love the sw@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the sw@@ um .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the sw@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single work institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the tot@@ ality ceased . &quot;
the sw@@ um of the engine was spe@@ ech@@ less .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my sw@@ um was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the sw@@ um I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; today , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , to be a teacher , a painter , a mother , to be a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and you know how the sw@@ um feels when the tot@@ um stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I already want to say No , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; Sch@@ ätz@@ chen . &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and I &apos;m bet@@ ting my tot@@ als , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of action , I can do nothing except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl lets go in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something within me is dissolved .
a mental door leaves and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sw@@ um slowly returns .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no mystery . no mystery . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; sums , sums of work , the amount of titanium , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sums are not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum depends on love .
the sw@@ um is the current that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sw@@ um is simple and original .
&quot; true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , because what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I make this a fixed rule , so that I can liber@@ ate myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to play as much as I work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what people prefer to work rather than being home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , is none of them . &quot;
&quot; we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst the bubbles .
&quot; I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always att@@ est to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
&quot; and talking my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I &apos;m mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more it does not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can get 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a day !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ als , to have a place for their peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
to the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m going to divor@@ ce and I &apos;ll be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show , when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track - why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sw@@ um came back in my spare time . the sw@@ um seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the tot@@ ality is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the sums of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that . &quot;
&quot; it is mine that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the real sum : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of living in me is wide . less titanium - more I do ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am the author . I think things out , I &apos;m raising you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to heal itself . &quot;
&quot; after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; an electrode im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered from severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; you have to imagine , that the brain sw@@ ells and increases the cran@@ ial pressure with skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ mas . &quot;
&quot; to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; to do this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; let cells grow from a piece of tissue , comparable to very small children taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded . &quot;
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you know from the biology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can transform into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are immort@@ al . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ ec@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark color in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ earned them at the t@@ apping point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ tap these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ tap the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we re @-@ so@@ aked the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ en@@ acted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ emp@@ tied .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we put the motor skills area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side you see the monkey that relax@@ es spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we re @-@ so@@ aked the cells : the same monkey , two months after implantation . &quot;
I can tell you that they were also very exciting for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope to show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first , you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and telling us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at it as an imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs carried out in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my recep@@ tive friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake lie , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future dark and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of wa@@ sting , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a peak is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy spar@@ rows and corporations , who , however , are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and bring income to produce the debt burden and also produce all the things humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds after a lot of money to compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and ex@@ alt the real estate prices . &quot;
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit which does not compensate for the usual market mechanisms .
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , like in an endless loop , would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up , &quot;
inad@@ vert@@ ently bring about the circumstances leading to the killing of oils .
this is my sh@@ arks with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many of them -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it attracted the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co@@ determination with the same voice @-@ wei@@ ghting in questions of the state of the state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy began only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy has begun , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , in that the economy gradually under@@ min@@ ed politics and dispos@@ ed of it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is due to the fact that one can be in the government today and still not in power , because the power is shifted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably depl@@ ete the animals , from which it nour@@ ishes , has decim@@ ated that at the end they are star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; it is similar with the economy that has har@@ assed politics so far that it itself har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest in the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin tops , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring back politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the theory of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to abo@@ lish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economics and politics are separate areas , automation lets the twin peaks become higher , the waste sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , just as it -- very soon as I believe -- will come in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance Hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he produced --
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; &quot; A@@ gor@@ a &quot; , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all revenues eman@@ ate from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated .
&quot; no distinction between those belonging to companies but not working in it , and employees working there where the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin tops . &quot;
&quot; in the realm of global political economy , please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is invested in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one didn &apos;t have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , particularly against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is simultaneously liber@@ ating in which it fav@@ ors privileged individuals , and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Luigi : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography itself .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only destabili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s perspective on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to blame China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells great after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the den@@ ial that a massive d@@ amping line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such an stra@@ ined situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the credi@@ tors &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring down our government , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , stood up : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to propose the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard the most , although he is probably responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and refers to Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are located right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the altitude shows how many shows will receive this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t enth@@ use . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing so , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online , where they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is out of nothing for nothing , you get up , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you skip or check again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide with these data then decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this reads : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give to the shows their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , what producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic says somehow that this should work with everything .
&quot; when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optim@@ izes it through very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time where we have more and more to use statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . if you come into contact with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the USA and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided if a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
the best results are not always generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , a bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly ceased to work , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flow rapidly into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the rule of law , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use lots of data to make serious choices , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , disman@@ tle this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then to make a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put pieces and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and minds where they are also part of the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with that decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they comp@@ eted for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; This is what the data tells us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or No @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will do it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have taken some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not alter the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball will wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend .
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
