<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally abdicated telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA handed over blueprints for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has declared against Risen and prompts him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked on risings, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had years of indication that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to tears."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of splitting and splitting up, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly concerned his phone calls,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit, and even travel references with the list of flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA Whistleblower and Risen's presumed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary condemned him more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistle-blowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional allowance, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that did not yet exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source surveillance system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet world famous by us, Swartz, and has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload or send documents, just like any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole, in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a chance to do misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for polluted waters of Flint. or a Wallstreet Insider, who warned us about the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak in history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and mighty] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like the Fonseca Mosque and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of $2 billion is leading to Russian President Vladimir Putin, over a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like an agent's plot or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years now."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a mattress soup.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is the case."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there were no prominent Americans, who came in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mosrucksack Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is true that in some U.S. countries, less information is needed, less information needs to be given to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to pick up particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave herself as african minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked all of us that all the way to a lawyer our investigator made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers accepted us as clients and of course nobody was handed over to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician who is embroiled in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very sad as if we could do nothing about it, as if nothing had ever changed, as if there were always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress which we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say," "Intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this kind of intransparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "together, we can finally end the transparency which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made an outlet sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the corps of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Ah, please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I get in there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I went out of bed, shout on toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people, who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment will be a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-cheese tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"this is how we presented the investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room their doors are closed when visit is over. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite other people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"however, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still with consolation, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you should focus on the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do anything like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic that you are feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of the guests feel like they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who now has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 opinions which all say: "he can really hold on very well unlocked mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought-out feedback system strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">"in the beginning, we did some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We have little surprise to the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation earns commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you are revealing."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I'm making a vacation with my family." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can it be created with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company relies on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need which was previously not covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to be celebrated or apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have trusted each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, wondrous can emerge."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save lives, even though they don't know one at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay is going on."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing coincide with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a commercial trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply" "rent industry" "to name, the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, you can compare it with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if journeys were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood that you never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, rather than isolation and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that the government belonged to,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"students, who were looking for a place to stay, were offered."</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were moved out. Incubator programmes were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. today, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a warm hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that one can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"we know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay with the check check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">"presumably, people do not talk to their competitors."</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a carcaker's fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga singing, because, baby, I was not born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, I thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was faith and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" "Eilert". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... ","... "In the name of Islam..."... "Jihad...,"... "bomb Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu, the deeds of others turned me into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I felt the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment this night, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "be vigilant," "Be careful," "Be careful," "Stay in well lit areas," "Don't be sampled."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warning:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque might be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or from people that were held for Muslims, in the open, and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we release them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, helpers and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques become safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking places free of charge, but do not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I recently told me, a leader of the police in Washington, DC: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalisation, one has found that he begins on-line. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their families so that the extreme group believes that terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or abused by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their imaginations, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">"the IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity."</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you look at them, they do not cast what they read in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every minister, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their fury, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam remarked the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our liberty of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show that when we fear we happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we tend to accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if people submit messages in which negative reports were reported about Muslims, they were more involved in military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood hits Muslims up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about being able to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the Faculty of Theology, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when did my brother become such a young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who visited her in the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a hobbyist, is about to become a multi-billion business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutes all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-packages came into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulence and in general react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively where mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available in the highest image e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrflügler, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starred wings, it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts coming together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospic, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight unit. it was invented short before."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right when everyone is watching is low, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monster is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the auspicious capability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly while flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a pallet of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took common micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there on Broadway wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, the reward lies in the development and the creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago two black holes circled each other in a very distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second turned into pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lightened brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, there has been mass life on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last trial to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes moved through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in essence, it was the fruits of my life's work."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a crow in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stole into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrating, lecturers often perform a really stupid dance in courses related to the theory of relativity."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and breathed by us when the waves were hit. average man's elongation was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is to say 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. that's why the Ligo staff explained to me crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by watching the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the case of sounds, it is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"this is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain features such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we can't make simple images of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we transform wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the All speaking."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simply chirp: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender of noise] Somebody knows what to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the bars of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the all and hear the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opaos are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Big Bang is obscured by its own light-light."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that all things exist which we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we had not expected."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the League project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the dinosaurs for our archaeological work so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us a completely different angle of view on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I tried out an experiment."</seg>

<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, I removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I am doing or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am the author. I think things out, bring you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I screamed TV. I'm producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I'm doing television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows simultaneously are in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days, four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run successively on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, all around the world burning."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who you are doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you're running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I don't understand it's dreaming about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm engrossed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as long as you wear a high tone, run a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the swum sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is a pleasure to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't you understand me wrong, you do it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the hum -- when I started television production when I began working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The swum is action and activity. the swum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the swum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totality is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you can no longer strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being different to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it means genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it says ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know I'm not going to fail, and I just know that I love the swum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the swum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The swum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my anny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the totality ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The swum of the engine was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My swum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing to delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the humming and the swum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "today, stupid author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you're doing it, you're working, you're working, you love what you're doing, to be a teacher, a painter, a mother, to be a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and you know how the swum feels when the totum stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late and she says," Mum, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I already want to say No, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" Schätzchen. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anyone any more. "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan and I'm betting my totals, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mum, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of action, I can do nothing except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl lets go in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something within me is dissolved.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door leaves and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The swum slowly returns.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No mystery. no mystery. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"sums, sums of work, the amount of titanium, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The swum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real swum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I make this a fixed rule, so that I can liberate myself as a workaholic of any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't have to play as much as I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what people prefer to work rather than being home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, is none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst the bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attest to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you think me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I'm mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more it does not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can get 15 minutes on the track, even in a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is important to feel the totals, to have a place for their peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'm going to divorce and I'll be victorious. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track - why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The swum came back in my spare time. the swum seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the totality is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is mine that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children are."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the other, the real sum: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of living in me is wide. less titanium - more I do!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am the author. I think things out, I'm raising you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most known, the" deep brain stimulation. "an electrode implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the neurons" circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved. "</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered from severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine, that the brain swells and increases the cranial pressure with skull-Hirn traumas."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"let cells grow from a piece of tissue, comparable to very small children taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"it is necessary to find proper nutrition, temperature, moisture and the surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François succeeded."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you know from the biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells, which can transform into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecorectin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark color in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-earned them at the tapping point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- auto transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-tap these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-tap the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we re-soaked the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-enacted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-emptied.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we put the motor skills area in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms. they recuperate to a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey that relaxes spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we re-soaked the cells: the same monkey, two months after implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at it as an immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally made clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs carried out in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my receptive friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake lie, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are blamed, our future dark and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of wasting, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a peak is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy sparrows and corporations, who, however, are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and bring income to produce the debt burden and also produce all the things humanity urgently needs, such as" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 trillion US dollar sounds after a lot of money to compare it with the $5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except to inflate the stock markets and exalt the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit which does not compensate for the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand that advocates the pessimism of investors, which, like in an endless loop, would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Inadvertently bring about the circumstances leading to the killing of oils.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy included too many of them --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it attracted the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political codetermination with the same voice-weighting in questions of the state of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, it is burnt out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-day liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy began only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy has begun, a relentless struggle between the two took place, in that the economy gradually undermined politics and disposed of it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is due to the fact that one can be in the government today and still not in power, because the power is shifted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably deplete the animals, from which it nourishes, has decimated that at the end they are starving."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar with the economy that has harassed politics so far that it itself harms itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest in the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "out of democracy, the higher the twin tops, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we must bring back politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The theory of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economics and politics are separate areas, automation lets the twin peaks become higher, the waste sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it -- very soon as I believe -- will come in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we must redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance Hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "appear as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" "Matrix", "in which machines serve human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" "Agora", "in long conversations the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues emanate from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those belonging to companies but not working in it, and employees working there where the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin tops."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the realm of global political economy, please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is invested in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one didn't have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, particularly against the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is simultaneously liberating in which it favors privileged individuals, and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Luigi: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography itself.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers describes as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is accurate, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am totally inactive."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you said very clearly what you think from the West's perspective on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I may say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to blame China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells great after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to the complacency and the denial that a massive damping line went through the eurozone, and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such an strained situation, he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the creditors' pages to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring down our government, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions that went through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It's worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, stood up:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the exposed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to propose the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard the most, although he is probably responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and refers to Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are located right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the altitude shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive to where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't enthuse."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing so, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online, where they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is out of nothing for nothing, you get up, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data then decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this reads:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give to the shows their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, what producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit frightening because we live in a time where we have more and more to use statistics to make serious choices, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. if you come into contact with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the USA and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided if a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">The best results are not always generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could predict outbreaks of influenza, a bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly ceased to work,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the release in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flow rapidly into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the rule of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginably use lots of data to make serious choices, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, dismantle this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together again and then to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is to put pieces and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think Netflix was so successful, because they used data and minds where they are also part of the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards "was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they competed for TV ideas, then selecting" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could always say," "This is what the data tells us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it's also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will do it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have taken some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend.</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, be an expert in what you do and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
