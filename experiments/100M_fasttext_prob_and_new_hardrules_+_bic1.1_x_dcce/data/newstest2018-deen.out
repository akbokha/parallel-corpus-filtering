Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change the city &apos;s view
&quot; an Irish @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people meet today . &quot;
a cryp@@ t chapel that is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the erst@@ while basis of peasants .
the oldest official Munich map promotes exciting stories about days .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everyone who had to get upset because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historic maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ a Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but especially very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not recognized as such .
&quot; in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called primitive signs , were incorporated into cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying management , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops crossed the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was the current neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bayern @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot;
the datas@@ he@@ et for Munich dates from 18@@ 56 and can be found on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) .
&quot; the comparison of earlier / today is most impressive , for example , the state capital . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is sub@@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was made 21 years after the map was created , so in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich city district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ s &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small par@@ c@@ els present no more farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the tavern &quot; or &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 there was the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden , headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with King Ludwig II &apos;s death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ ases of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he has also forbidden the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was room first , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point also this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k ren@@ own in hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , there is the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric atri@@ ums . &quot;
&quot; at the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , you@@ ths meet in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational facilities .
&quot; the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East lies west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
citizen Rights Group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ours has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special care when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and noted here , &quot; says the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimin@@ ations , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately targets minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , which happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they will be stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist violations against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken prisoner by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosecutor &apos;s Office , which is shown that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people have to be ready whether to bring money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued a Travel War@@ ning for Texas and Arizona , following the adoption of immigration laws which oblig@@ ate local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the fishing village Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n @-@ Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary separ@@ ators Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given a picture on site .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the right @-@ wing grav@@ eyard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , provided 40 dairy cows and as many young cattle and accommodated in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , so pi@@ voting . &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales can be found on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ arten .
&quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit on such steep surfaces .
&quot; green land care for a lot of work , much has to be handled with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and took possession of it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if it did not lead to bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be extended quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often critici@@ zed because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot;
&quot; the open area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs of 71 500 euros were supported by the leader , a quarter contributed to the Municip@@ ality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers or land@@ lady . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; here , best foods are produced . &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ schaft@@ spra@@ y@@ gui@@ deline ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
the pres@@ up@@ position is the presence of a conveying system described by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be fli@@ pper@@ y ( inclin@@ ation more than 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the 2018 fish@@ tail sub@@ project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the area of conservation measures 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans like every other - therefore the carefully orchest@@ rated down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ages would have dy@@ ed him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took the meaning of it , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to talk about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it concerns the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , the el@@ emental waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable litter &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
&quot; this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America . &quot;
Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a classical metap@@ hor@@ ical representation .
&quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls no one , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative , who brings the American flame to the um@@ nach@@ ged world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch is not to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , el@@ emental , but hop@@ eful people after long and often aw@@ ful journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to recognise . &quot;
&quot; their torch shall not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds of a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Team of Great Britain
&quot; the power director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics division , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain speech was incredible , &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , which E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has established five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being so special about Team Chap@@ ter@@ in is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me , it makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the activation of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at the critic , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 persons who have vo@@ iced their opinions on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like h@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat@@ head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; this is why the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just true people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I said pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users , blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter @-@ recor@@ ders were beating on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ica , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes to enjoy home comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for hom@@ ey comfort over the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led next year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the En@@ dr@@ unde before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels very special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not have the Extre@@ ma@@ dura open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year are coming back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour on his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to his home floor . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad how it went so far .
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ uth . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking lot is £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;

reduction of lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) came to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking a year , &quot; said Director of the Hei@@ ko Becher study director . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he approached his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 cases of lung cancer due to passive smoking in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; said the manager of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which continues to hin@@ der construction work , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off heads is already enormous , &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a cooker . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai countryside in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are drinking heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public raising in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , stem@@ ming from the independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated sheets , which were converted into different yellow tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eigner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her vivid , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also the country of Indonesia .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port was min@@ ed in the value of $ 3.1 billion of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has assets valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists more than 500@@ ,000 Papua has been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe in the 1970 @-@ s were subjected to genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Are All S@@ elling &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic mig@@ r@@ és come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ een sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are struggling to keep up with them .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has tasted the native Papua ( M@@ um @-@ Mama , the women &#93; of Papua . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ Stephen Y@@ uli@@ o , was beaten so severely that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center in order to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - running around in circles and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sling stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station just because they were being attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings took place on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura where he vo@@ iced sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address historical ab@@ uses in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused by the UN for crimes against humanity , demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights have already been included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , scar@@ ed to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the opinion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company , who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others died , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who responded by firing warning shots . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered here quickly , thus TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ print for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Papua @-@ Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by inf@@ ecting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport have arrived in a larger number . &quot;
the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai clan . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , international media coverage remains ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is won the campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua with the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s alleg@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; Indonesia still holds a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is found in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims offered a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least let them not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and shou@@ ting of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident who named his name George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 o GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire , and cooled the building . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the outer casing for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police told them that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his great Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority for this sport . &quot;
&quot; the often very long , but also very much cher@@ ished five @-@ set classics remain the traditional judgement . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work to improve the applications .
&quot; at all , it was not until the vote that the proposal came to the final in a neutral place after many in@@ consist@@ encies . &quot;
&quot; new starting in 2018 is only comparatively small details , so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round of the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizer , the requirements in terms of training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a pol@@ l out &quot;
&quot; a pol@@ l under flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items passed by at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally wore prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed they had delayed the fact that they had travelled er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were tow@@ ed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent reported to have know@@ ingly worn items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it asked travellers across the country to find out how many inad@@ vert@@ ently brought s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
&quot; it is no surprise that the people who are most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through the safety , those who fly the most frequently . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they may take along or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far signed that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k will first reveal another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , which has just begun . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k is now dre@@ aming : 6@@ 3,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; for a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are taking place in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be - 500@@ ,000 - one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; who orders a Model 3 today , may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never before tested production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the lack of rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , with@@ drew his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground level o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was accused of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly forced to block or delay regul@@ ators to resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ction regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington ruled that the EPA car@@ et@@ aker had exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its turn @-@ around in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused of groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines serious . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; however , the EPA statement said that sometime P@@ ru@@ itt will use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available enforcement &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive version of the o@@ zone rules .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius station is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ ble@@ gens their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ary &apos;s Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Land Registry : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen , with the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the document , on the Hill of the Hill , apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard with which the church or the patron saint belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the town @-@ picture of Tum@@ loops are still to be recognized , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are setting up these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
&quot; a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied it with a priest remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit the church . &quot;
this was associated with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two were torn to Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be em@@ itted later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
&quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and the church mill , and used it as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hil@@ ary was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s eight in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ ble@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ary &apos;s chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the subur@@ b Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest .
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius station which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ ble@@ gens are particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to appro@@ ve approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim distances itself &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days before the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a mal@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval of approval remains illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to current proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large grounds . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of around 11 400 households are to be covered - equivalent to one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg region . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract residents to shopping in the city centre .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekend should sensi@@ tise customers for what offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket product . &quot;
&quot; according to plan , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite to the &quot; &quot; midnight snack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the near@@ er region .
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the trade association and the city go to a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive Down@@ town . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts in order to make them active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly broad@@ cast@@ ed , the king had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; apart from Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; advertise for the appreciation of local commerce and increase its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the campaign led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchase behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school

&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
a first missing was later also found dead .
the dead were the cler@@ ks of the school .
&quot; as a result , the authorities presum@@ ed to work on a gas pipe . &quot;

Tru@@ mp came under pressure following the tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp asked En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border . &quot;
&quot; the US president den@@ ounced him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to this , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and unveiled a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the USA who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp stopped the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activ@@ ist activ@@ ates rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ elles as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ era Ford Mer@@ cury was driving through a group of spectators in the rural mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , had reached the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n -- -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ de . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but if a sling is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience ble@@ w out very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge came back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ yn@@ red by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 year old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life long civil rights activ@@ ist .
&quot; for him , retro@@ sp@@ ect serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness .
a court physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one ever was accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia made it possible for the first time to vote in the pre @-@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com sat down a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ors in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they got away from prison and were approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concluded an F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and the local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and deceived the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and vote if you vote then this will happen .
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual refin@@ ement of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the play . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; for years he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member , but he said the role will never be simpler . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ ving of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and precisely there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and quick .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman dressed with a grief dress stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie &apos;s holidays mour@@ ning pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country where the ly@@ n@@ ch @-@ kill@@ ings took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch and wipe their tears away .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ dd@@ les Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience collabor@@ ates with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at one table , a white pair of white from Atlanta is talking about the re @-@ position with a black pair that they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was fighting to find words which felt the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do what they do because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he eats and reminds us of civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ ordination is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ ma@@ ged@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a multi @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ine &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open @-@ minded Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ daughters pose as rock @-@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through its &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine @-@ breeders - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise perfectly with the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they mis@@ lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ush a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ man@@ ners and give the ri@@ ver@@ o @-@ cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen surrounding the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he smil@@ ed Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe in it .
the audience ow@@ es it to the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are being celebrated stor@@ my , who mo@@ dest@@ ly and bowed the hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat back in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to let go of the flute concert , five years later , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his point of view . &quot;
I draw a positive resume .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their voluntary year at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; crowd : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I am helping here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a later @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focus perhaps too . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social services in the winter semester .
I will study dual studies and probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you are doing its FS@@ J .
you can make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from Civil Engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not about calculating stat@@ s . &quot;
&quot; there are always other people in the head , each of whom have a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is the same . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts another 3.000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will build another 3,000 jobs and cut down their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; job cuts , announced by General Director John Fall@@ on mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner last month , said that the outlook for the business year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul in the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say civil servants . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , announc@@ ing an explanation of NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violent crime that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people close to the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised sprin@@ kling &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are being treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram Airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide motor @-@ car killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops hit the Taliban in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the force under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is weighing up the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the Smo@@ g rule according to K@@ lagen@@ um
&quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states compl@@ ained the agency because of their stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ O announced on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ordin@@ ances 2015 , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone provisions , in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to drive a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda to boost growth , according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature reserves that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website states that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce the lung function and increase the respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot;
community wants community room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ votes , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing part of the estate is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it still remains until the area owned by the church has been owned by the church , there is now no more planning obstacle for the project to be formed by a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a community space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the municipality . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are floating in front of such a common room not as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ite @-@ just living , but openly into the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be passed through funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the refurbish@@ ment area .
&quot; the establishment of a shared space would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposal is to signal the investor to signal that there is no cap between the legs in this respect , the finding that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the environment - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the height of the tr@@ uss and makes the construction more economical - they would be possible . &quot;
&quot; unnecessary , so don &apos;t just think about Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not that easy in the common room .
&quot; Daniela Ruf also refers to the many own buildings with which one does not come so much forward , but now they lean towards the common room out of the window , says it : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m difficult with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden sub@@ vention of any anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real , in case of doubt a market@@ able counter @-@ value , that is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ zione &apos;s proposal to cut the proposal accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; this is the case with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : cyclists is hur@@ led on road
&quot; while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told us , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den on the cycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder hit the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old help .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospital by a ret@@ ou@@ ting carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ kal@@ winner .
personnel are getting bigger at the German football record master Bayern Munich on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ ei@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must abst@@ ain from David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; also , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official play of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play smart , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
walking in the resin of star to star
the first &quot; star path &quot; is to be built in the resin .
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information of many har@@ bour@@ go@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; good achiev@@ able installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; please ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star path will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why the stars had different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although it was far more distant . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 at the initiative of the &quot; &quot; Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , &quot; &quot; the University @-@ Stadt has something similar to the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the planet trail . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded plug to the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away and measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet trail is just four kilometers .
&quot; while the light of the sun is about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to reach the stal@@ k with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
the march to the next fix@@ er would last for half a year .
&quot; Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation super @-@ spring counter@@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia kno@@ cked out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to lightweight .
and he has to move to lightweight counter@@ parts &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it was to be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he loves Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may be participating in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko continued with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show pot@@ ency , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could sense the momentum for their own struggle .
this is the battle that must be done .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Ver@@ last according to Tire Plat@@ form@@ ers
&quot; during an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car pulled to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about one hour , followed by traffic on the left lane of the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener of Braunschweig , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triple chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after an open fire doesn &apos;t want to capture the For@@ tun@@ as anymore .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experience in preparing with the triple @-@ chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is convinced of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gi@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build good , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not afford such a lot of playing mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about an accident from a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely for a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , because they don &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; says the internal defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rhin@@ eland come as a light favorite on Sunday in an encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep it away just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is stup@@ idity , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to hit from the outset , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Princip@@ e . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement , would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
&quot; and so , Funk@@ el wants to see his players in no case on Sunday . &quot;
new results of Swedish asylum seekers application tests published
&quot; recent results of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ Medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they are to make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish migration authority ( Migration verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were age @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot;
tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases which suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus , the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the paper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full on the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven ton heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Traffic and Transport in the Prime Minister of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three need@@ ing bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge of concrete that is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons wei@@ ghted so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border for@@ tification that is also used as operating mode .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to run .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
the traffic in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is regulated by a traffic light for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting trail towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the cost of the three types of bridges is 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull in one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to put under a hat is coming together . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) are part of a broad alliance that is showing a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud poster &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D speakers , but to demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the city @-@ picnic was originally planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reported that he took care of such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked for Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is what it does : at 8 p.m. on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz there will be a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ person Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listeners in the hall , waiting for the top candidates for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch holding their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; there is a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ av@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the row Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov &apos;s solo trumpet player at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo voice of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach works with the two as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play mix to a fascinating total art work . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately had a bitter experience . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brunette performer ple@@ dges to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I &apos;ve been in love with everyone I have had . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that it was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; she particularly suffered , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but at school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy , &quot; Not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public does not like to explain their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect you to maintain yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of contempl@@ ation ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp previously announced a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes finds that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the regime change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us from working on our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; said the president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ l@@ akh@@ tin spoke during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes competing gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supporting the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ deploy Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral procession for Mali dra@@ fted in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
&quot; to the still un@@ explained crash situation , Secretary of Defense Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; but she described the two reverse drivers as &quot; &quot; no@@ isse@@ urs of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and brought to the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that the funeral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Premier Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the chief inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; rose ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the soldiers &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ra@@ zed . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built up the flight operation of the fighter @-@ helicopter tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment with which the soldiers were , said , &quot; If this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; no doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : deployment would be dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral ceremony the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with the decision of her husband .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also lays down the title &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; because Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , the painter Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility . &quot;
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies with the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand with the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social intellectual intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Minister @-@ President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , but does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke out on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; prior to that , the start@@ ling withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their country parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jacket founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( N@@ aro@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn The fol@@ ks@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on the 14th of January next year .
N@@ aro@@ ler said the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether or not to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable for the Parliament to decide its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Land@@ tag withdraw@@ s confidence to the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be legally tested thoroughly , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , one will discuss all the questions if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
&quot; the fol@@ ks@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ ern@@ ens &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; but somewhat kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it referred to as a tag of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she has received her Land@@ tag mandate , which she received from the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; divided the president of the state , Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets . &quot;
they have deliberately decided not to express any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even in the light of the background , there were no substantial differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony @-@ based Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the head of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian is &quot; &quot; in its last vanity and in its fru@@ stration , their personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is making this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat out political capital .
Christian Democ@@ rat &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Kos@@ ks@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ jackets into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed the v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career presents . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD &apos;s strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a voice in parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves against gre@@ ed , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech and Ans@@ wer .
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp on the stamp .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs batch . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all we know presently , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived .
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; as well as the makers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if the return maximum content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are not pass@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the farms are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the present state of knowledge , the production companies are not directly responsible . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too little controllers in the emergency . &quot;
is it missing only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
&quot; it was just the official controls , which revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where off@@ ences can occur are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear several times that I expect complete enlightenment by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ arms in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by cutting @-@ edge funds , manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; fundamentally , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it is necessary to work consistently on all levels and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and without gaps .
how the financial rules of soccer affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expenditure of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record Transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation controlling the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G must prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without big losses . &quot;
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars in the face of the funding of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar .
&quot; associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be counter@@ ed with legitimate revenue streams , which enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election for the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that associations , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P creation period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor , Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly enhance the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the proceeds for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs seeking to over@@ clock its financial supervision by infl@@ aming its revenue by companies , connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be counted as legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor was added by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambass@@ adors will be ambassador and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to follow any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last owner to PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because one can have different paths or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has produced chocolate for the Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
&quot; on request of the news agency , Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white containers of up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers , before landing . &quot;
Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of order according to &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; like many applicants , the Swiss does not want to reveal it . &quot;
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the agreement on spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , chocolate bars are distributed on board of their flights . &quot;
&quot; before signing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut has delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
Swiss made the way to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers will be spoiled with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers S@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class , also distri@@ butes the short circuit . &quot;
athle@@ tics - Dis@@ cus Olympics Champion Robert Hart@@ ing achieves World Cup Final
the three @-@ time World Champion cont@@ ests a medal on Saturday in the final .

&quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5,@@ 13 metres , qualified for the final battle . &quot;
no@@ stal@@ gia turns into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 years Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd lob@@ ster ( it contained an original story for a promising young vegetables , spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by getting stuck on the core of the day - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children , who will grow up , they still managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sh@@ ook the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character sticks through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy , vi@@ cious plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ spoken impression by Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ b@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could make this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds us of another kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ west ring battle icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; created comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English are syn@@ ced .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice tags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de out the voice &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan @-@ mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better supply its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow to Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in hitting the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years old and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; in addition , officials established large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in the same period of time , two persons were arrested in Italy . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two will therefore be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of crimin@@ ality , violent acts , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; as early as the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz outlines the organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo were a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning , the Grand Prix was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the investigations , mainly Italian nation@@ als drew near to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on 27th May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
fashion be@@ mo@@ ans large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners &apos; register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decision decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to a media report on large gaps in the foreign affairs register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to some serious mis@@ decision in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; had received . &quot;
&quot; according to data , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been adequately maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 was found in individual cases , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on a sufficient number of people , EU citizens are also included who do not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; such false orders , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient tax@@ pay@@ ers , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , if they have entered the country . &quot;
&quot; this is what emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper therefore calls for &quot; &quot; the BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; meanwhile the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy submitted guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; other EU states , too , would return refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ en@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening illegal detention conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the defici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best results achieved
&quot; in a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , blood donation service has already been available for other people . &quot;
at least of the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule is ahead of all , who with his now 100 donations now distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are laid out for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Kreis@@ ler Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserves are broken into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher talked about the actions carried out in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many make reservations from Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter paid ten times per 500 milli@@ litres of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have sub@@ du@@ ed spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when they retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members reaching an increase in this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and expected to continue for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to raise the inflation @-@ heated inflation from the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the credit costs could possibly rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimul@@ us package issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the next February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for cooling inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale than the markets are expecting . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and the next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast projected in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rates and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is likely to recover slightly towards the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tightening is getting worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent in@@ comes &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages can be &quot; &quot; recovered &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote causing the sin@@ king of the ground .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy fully .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanded an increase of 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation in the last month decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said it was expected and will put it on again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ ale , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses looking to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks very good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are completed , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle in front of the High Court against the funding of the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial following the Supreme Court judgment last year , confirming that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ p pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV @-@ preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission at risk of infection .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person &apos;s body to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified to identify suitable participants , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase .
&quot; the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , which is targeted and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , targeted specifically for vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Ter@@ r@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one having a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
it is now important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society .
living life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former farmer with a passion for real estate , declined in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely refurbished . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the requirement .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were st@@ acked on top of each other , without the need for mos@@ quit@@ oes . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance there are mirr@@ ored units for all cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering work went there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ strengthened , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is wei@@ ghty , so it sli@@ ps very easily when you push the door . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the soil . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that touch you and which therefore help create an emotional attachment in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of some standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could choose to not leave it . &quot;
brothers struggling for a 500 million US dollar property empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate on one of the largest real estate investment in Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be split . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with their mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns the value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I was holding for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed , had excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has held back very much although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .

Tru@@ mp@@ s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a smooth course . &quot;
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior staff at his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry with unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February vis @-@ à @-@ vis Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habits under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media use includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s Twitter custom ever was &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets without their intervention would have contained even more ignition material .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are continually trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dil@@ ection of the advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons , to provide dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp , like a volcano , can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that it is getting rigi@@ dly to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone reluc@@ t@@ antly rejected a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ash ram . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the people will be asked and hoped for . &quot;
the police across Europe send post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminal are not known naturally , clu@@ es from the population are hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the action that follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar in winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ es were hiding on holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for searched crus@@ hers from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ host@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online chan@@ ts have been arrested until now , at least 11 of them due to refer@@ r@@ als after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travelers on the foot of the war , who negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn from the community to claim a field in front of their mansion houses . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought with horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council , in order to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
the Council must be forced into action by shame for implementation as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
&quot; the travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .
&quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay for my community , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep it as fast as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case .
from Birken@@ hof you will find Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is taken from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Birken@@ hof hotels by the then ambience of operating company l@@ t@@ d. ap@@ ril 13 , 2014 , about 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also income from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of more serious prospects at the house .
he should keep right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , there have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is remo@@ del@@ ed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; nicely bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated downtown level , Sch@@ erer stresses . &quot;
&quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 guest rooms , wants to spread widely , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople should feel at ease in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to decide exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the outer complexes are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in an inner courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is open to the public by the restaurant . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee received the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; with regard to the persons entrusted to the matter . &quot;
the paper received the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations .
the sender CN@@ N reported that there are already first pres@@ sings of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a longer time interfer@@ ing in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s electoral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ers of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s in a private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post , &quot; a few weeks ago , wrote that the Sonder@@ er Tru@@ mp was personally put into the centre and accused the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in potential crime cases and decide whether to raise charges .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called ank@@ le bun@@ tings .
&quot; in most cases , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be powered by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite people to the hearing under oath .
&quot; according to the sender CN@@ N , inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s couns@@ ellor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his son @-@ in @-@ law Paul Man@@ a@@ fort took part in the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the translation show that Mu@@ eller would not intim@@ id@@ ate himself in his work , and that he should act quickly if necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on an accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not to be determined against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was called in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been employed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he had to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey told a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the National Security Ad@@ vis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff . &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulation on whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired up by the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators set forth draft laws on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be dismissed as simple as possible . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin is solved by the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , which weighs more than one tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with its length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for humans .
&quot; according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the down@@ fall of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , for some 30 years , however , there have been a series of unusual clas@@ hes of ice s@@ nu@@ ck@@ les in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ et background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ age was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete cow@@ shed is crum@@ bled there , A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf cow@@ ardi@@ m is in danger , as the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate can be under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and push ice as much water as it results after melting .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small degree , the British research project writes on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists are argu@@ ing whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf should grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ fo@@ ils of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have crum@@ bled over the past decades . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature has contributed to this decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med by around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore t@@ ines to the areas where the temperature rises at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to pay tribute to the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have penet@@ rated . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 apprenti@@ ces have left their first working day . &quot;
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be published this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann County . &quot;
&quot; among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the EEC and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should &quot; develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the forward @-@ looking shortage of applicants in the future . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and externally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include an education offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees that reti@@ re from the service of disease or age . &quot;
&quot; the highest time to act , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter League , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint motion with his party . &quot;
&quot; he was already worried about a big surprise already in the day of the cir@@ cus , when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses and start@@ led the remaining parties . &quot;
&quot; people want all the possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; said nations . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually envis@@ ages the public service &apos;s tari@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are available only if one changes to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be furnished in which employees care about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked together effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express himself in detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , saving human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in a statement on the social media . &quot;
we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the crew aboard hos@@ hous@@ ebo@@ at migrants , who will be delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was said to take place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must especially have an Italian police officer who over@@ sees their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize winner organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy following the rescue measures in Italy has declined dramatically over the past few weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine For@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Trieste and Si@@ ghts for four days . &quot;
&quot; for this , three friendly guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; once again , look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , joined by &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many altitude metres were announced again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought un@@ welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ e cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neustadt was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best site - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium during wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels . &quot;
this has also been recognised by the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine which are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning made 2015 of the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; that on this train some clubs are rising . &quot;
&quot; this weekend , the FIFA World Federation organizes the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in London where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises one agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that the young people will also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be much more present on these markets online than once a year to send the Swiss Federal Reserve to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the soccer simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , le@@ agues have long since established themselves in which the pros are competing against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a kind of sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; e @-@ sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , such as increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive skills require a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid re@@ activity . &quot;
professional g@@ amer should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the finest player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , there are also problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to carry through online games and in the scene the structures of the classic sport failed .
the scientist highlights the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport in a positive way .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth to the E @-@ Sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to lie at 130 million . &quot;
that is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte counsel@@ ors write . &quot;
internationally many countries are already on the agenda .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;

there is a lot going on in Europe too .
&quot; e @-@ sport has been introduced as a ped@@ ago@@ gue in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only to decay in no@@ stal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time adjusting the company to the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football remains the way it was .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced Con@@ rad Roy to suicide for the lyrics
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were subjected to par@@ ole . &quot;
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the Roy &apos;s father said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ directed eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she totally regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age &quot; or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their mental illness will have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day in which I am not be@@ having the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity despite all my pain , which we will bear for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ y &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer the only person I have been together with since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to demand another commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get up yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is switch on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot;
Ju@@ dge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter attracted attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should take advantage of any press from the event .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter in 2007 because of murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not imprisonment . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ oto : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua k@@ im@@ me was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern has a big season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t harm there .
&quot; something else was different in his place in the cabin , Joshua made Kim@@ chi right away , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as Bavaria &apos;s captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ i was also able to interpret the sign from the coach .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader from the youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of holiday professionals , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar l is best distributed to those , to whom you want a lot , which you want to keep in a mood . &quot;
&quot; so , who was chosen to compete in Lah@@ m &apos;s legacy , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m . &quot;
&quot; to the right side , this is his position , the white band@@ age at the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general , Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation as the one who can best take the helm . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to direct the un@@ installed troops .
he had a look for the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
&quot; V@@ idal &apos;s ability to re@@ play his missing fitness ( folding hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , to get out of the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it not to be negative in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm often did heavy , and Sü@@ le tried a few times also in the match @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed ti@@ dy performance at the de@@ but@@ ing .
&quot; mod@@ al shift , tempo change : &quot; I was picked up for this style as well . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked at the game following the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to his new te@@ amm@@ ate after some cris@@ p statements .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he no longer has to teach the new . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz State Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy on a T V request - and at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
&quot; of course , the biggest down@@ turn sees in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the priority list of the country . &quot;
&quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , until 2021 is intended to be construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the west border Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Mini@@ steri@@ liz@@ erin Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as suggested by Wis@@ ser , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the I@@ HK pra@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2,500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master &apos;s education . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is to provide quick facts , at the same time , the country has the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce . &quot;
&quot; up to now only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to employ Wis@@ ser in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; s &amp; D spokesperson on CD@@ U , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us is expecting a concept of the country as to how it will solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the former broad@@ band expansion in the country is not@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with Note 3.6 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of discre@@ pan@@ cies she already cleared the field . &quot;
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chairman said that the company said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and thus applied to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe modified to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen ox@@ ides , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust f@@ umes ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles , too , will also make it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which were able to regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ position devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former leader of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and an enquiry focused on the United States has been extended . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft pass through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if on Saturday pul@@ ls again to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building reference wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ otran@@ s@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be shar@@ per as a protective wild river . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot;
mur@@ m@@ ary n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most commonly published carto@@ ons carto@@ ons , the rab@@ bit n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an still works and works on a film .
&quot; his message : &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a sign for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread widely worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings , which has an exchange @-@ foot@@ er as a counterpart . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he rather uses the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ally . &quot;
Lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of d@@ rought and due to diseases , which scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ goat transm@@ its , and in very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for vac@@ ation@@ ers but also for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed , and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are taken into account include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian forest celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval feast .
&quot; shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , merchants , vag@@ ants or a country house camp should be experienced in the city centre on these days . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet in Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the Repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s wage list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resting period of violence , and as the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and although the terrain is now even more treas@@ ured . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we urge all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of stu@@ d@@ ded , two @-@ level m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second error was not to force Val@@ dez , after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter in 2003 when he joined up with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US @-@ Dollar shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without hitting the drug problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper served a reputation for courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for their courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to cur@@ l like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit there always at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine of his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their home starting and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong@@ ly , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; Sm@@ ell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is done with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside we were looking for two polic@@ emen protecting against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were mand@@ ated by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some repor@@ ters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce gave birth to three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the former known box@@ er Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
&quot; and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belongs to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on foot@@ paths and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them circul@@ ate because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked for her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her fur@@ y has injured her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a society that is equally valid . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
the media guard group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; last year accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note , allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kartell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who , in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , indicates that drug traffi@@ cking makes him scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ eted riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues escal@@ ating as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the Ri@@ odo@@ ce website via mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the polic@@ emen who held guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; when they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue though a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now found that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the reserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r &quot; ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well preserved condition has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is likely to be threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and avoid his enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ rs made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
it points to the fact that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by sufficient pressure through car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution would favour the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dose @-@ carrier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been the cra@@ dle , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life , including his preserved intestinal contents , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , came into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative fl@@ ak@@ y skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as much today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just sli@@ pped a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ an Age was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal &quot; Current Biology , &quot; believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the du@@ sty ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin @-@ st@@ alli@@ ons still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread to the top . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass @-@ kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , miles long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , at 5@@ pm , between the connecting quarters of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , nearly 30 vehicles were injured during a thunder@@ storm , including trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of injured . &quot;
&quot; it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large range of lif@@ ebo@@ ats was at the accident place .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich an approximately ten kilometres long back @-@ up was formed .
&quot; as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there was also on the counter @-@ road to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , which now have to be expected with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident place .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting , one sits in the train and sleeps . &quot;
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ hi@@ ft or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the road@@ map control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and use it to vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will be available early next year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; refers to the train card de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
&quot; it also has to be purchased through the app of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for the electronic evaluation appears . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train driver arrives at the ticket control at number Y , he knows there is a passenger sitting there with already vali@@ dated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can go to sleep , continue working , keep silence . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew , you simply check in the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Head of Marketing Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often travels , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest problems . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the travelling companions do not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document you need to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train drivers and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the section or large room and delays in controlling your tickets and taking the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not available yet .
&quot; as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question , &quot; &quot; Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police and people crying out , and by a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; says Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we get used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas after the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists in the view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; had the black experience and the black state &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
what is happening today is a climax of what has happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience an anti @-@ lat@@ ent racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would make her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local stock@@ holder who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in Organ@@ izing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt &apos;s occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people will be presented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah guide , but a community that is coming together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , how she fell in love and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not by chance , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;

from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though they are not built for a long time yet .
but the idea of a shopping mall on the southern end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the theme is hardly cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; It would be awesome &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , as the rest of the shops will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct will be bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot in which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will be an end . &quot;
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a place with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes made by the land@@ lady again and again very gladly . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s ei for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is that too .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .
but this might not be very low in the new project . &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; why shopping bag in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but as there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store stores are rented in a shopping mall only from larger firms , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; as a pity , specialty stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where is the farmer &apos;s market hall to go during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , doesn &apos;t need anyone . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - how I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; once the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which resem@@ ble almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly - hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st pur@@ ged a 35 @-@ year prison term after she publicly publi@@ ci@@ zed diplomatic news about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA derived from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time , and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal bricks , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which President Chel@@ seas verdict would convert and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; Obama actually only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also a low and heavy battle at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fl@@ ames the stub@@ born divisions that he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence , a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the comic @-@ novel mentioned above . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how they appear in the hands of the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; when they turn up your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was fores@@ een in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulator , which unite like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nation @-@ wide human ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are considered susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ a ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown by the acts of the Local Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a Community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event and det@@ ectives investigate the bul@@ ks as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
La@@ a has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ a had now been evaluated and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair that is being investigated by the relevant authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and the Somer@@ ville College told in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a vision of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
&quot; said Russian Vice Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko , it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the requirements of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of USA@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged stat@@ ely funded dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in Moscow , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; in order to be deployed again . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
&quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company which shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low consent results - so that you can pursue why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the resour@@ ceful let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and detect poor behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line where staff can report bad behaviour .
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company finds its employees poorly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , &quot; Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to prosec@@ ute the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously were hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or unfair intern@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the Arthur Ander@@ sen accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for using their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
G@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only missions . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors gain ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; when the third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change isn &apos;t coming fast enough or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not going to follow employees , &quot; &quot; Have you really listened to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , thus saving . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to better bonding of employees in a branch known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ se on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the fin@@ als on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the fry shifted the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as held six playing times in West@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; in the course of August , 18 exercises will be held . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ As , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ ank further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we get to the Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is over , in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that already cleared a net behind a tor@@ so , which will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then sett@@ ling there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties , and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible fal@@ si@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual reviews , which may show results of the fact examination from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories prior to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to get rid of hat@@ eful post@@ ings such as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature on the &quot; related articles &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .
create a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its comfortable seat in the Guardian River Valley in K@@ ent , and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ er@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it was there . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome pit &quot; ) , it all seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key &quot; and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only gaining full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , &quot; in which aristoc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who possessed what had : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century portra@@ ys his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has made a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ trac@@ ted by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; alas , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle conce@@ als in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the eiling of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August it is supposed to be the highlight of the campaign on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website which was released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; at the same time , we are firmly convinced that we as a Bad Honne@@ fer citizens know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is about more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one which gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five @-@ digit amount and cost the campaign .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara about pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting took place no more in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs were also involved in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess . &quot;
the government is attracting the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the forces of the air forces and the nav@@ y were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 persons involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan actually has the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article titled &quot; Un@@ hair@@ y in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big part in the army and the security forces continues at any rate .
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 military servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the lords of the country .
&quot; three times , they cast their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving pur@@ pos@@ efully an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particular non @-@ appointed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt from persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance following the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by changing the way US will change the way citizens are issued from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate the route for race @-@ driven shuttle
&quot; again and again , over the past few months over the future of the racing car had been cont@@ ested - now it is going to be very fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist track drives , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing car in the long term , construction work will begin on the track according to the Ministry of Transport in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this important connection especially for tourism , &quot; declared Minister Secretary Klaus atonement on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future by the country , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared at@@ oning . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this includes the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards , &quot; he said . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the race @-@ level shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in recent months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is very b@@ ump@@ y in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when he released his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; his robot accordingly to his convic@@ tions , selecting everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , who conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it also has its mo@@ ods - like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female qualities , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one of the most . &quot;
&quot; on his site True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys . &quot;
their formation and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ gation as an optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R appreci@@ ates their increasing popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
but what is transp@@ iring from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots will appear at a time in which women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ unc@@ ed to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most sc@@ ary aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphical images , the lo@@ osen body and the st@@ amped eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that points to independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to put it in the articul@@ ation of 2017 : maid service
tru@@ mp &apos;s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s choosing relatives . &quot;
we all are supposed to strain all of us to burst our filter bubbles .
the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring families together was less noticed .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ right poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which she strug@@ gled for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it seems to me in another context that this also ent@@ ails significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the acting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs should not be rep@@ elled one day . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness compared to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself inf@@ ested by an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ gical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp are indeed a very mild criminal . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp passes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ous@@ el , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ishing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the issues pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience since two years old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the valuation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic gr@@ inning while I was tired of having the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was taken to hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to the first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day by firing her in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a several times in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that it is too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ative Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four@@ thous@@ äs@@ sler from F@@ oot and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 pupils of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dancing . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , carrying the cylinders to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ er An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young @-@ animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished each district chan@@ ger that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; thank@@ sgiving was followed by colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps into instruc@@ tional bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cooking time is over now , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only dis@@ cour@@ aged her students , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they were able to rely on the four @-@ block chan@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
eight first che@@ aters have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illegal people was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and lay down to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emission characteristics of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Car Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no . the software updates handled are voluntary .
&quot; the obligatory updates before are only valid for the vehicles that have the software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the retro@@ fitting was ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Agency ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date . &quot;
Daimler indicated to write to each person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its frame . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions last ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fear that .
but in the regions where travel b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
&quot; in rural areas , there are currently no impair@@ ment losses for older dies@@ els . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the award winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honored . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the ceremony . &quot;
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the funds - and that burden me . &quot;

we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to pension in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already adverti@@ sed - however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been City Engineer . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he conve@@ ys in the press conference .
&quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he is surprised that no application has been completed so far . &quot;
the city is looking for architects or civil engineers at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in this way , under consideration of regular periods of notice , there is still plenty of time to prepare for it . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administration &apos;s community as a sub@@ contractor , the applicant must present relevant degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer complete them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but proximity to citizens is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the h@@ ack@@ ers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its staff . &quot;
&quot; however , also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz are about to be encountered . &quot;
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will make a book with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is plenty of room for a town building master . &quot;
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gardening you can react very flexibly on a lot .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection ensemble , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going mayor of the city emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the mayor of the town bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything goes through my table . &quot;
&quot; in terms of care and coordination , he can count on many years of co @-@ operation : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and staying with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , you should have completed an completed academic studies as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of Construction and Construction Law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt stands under construction and civil engineering , construction management , basic building facilities , municipal property courtyard with building yard and urban gar@@ dener and Lower Building Law Authority , including the Protection of Monum@@ ents . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : South @-@ way route closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; close to the crime scene , a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bike rider were watched by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a kingdom of Lus@@ ati@@ a , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have brought themselves in great danger , endanger@@ ing the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the cost of the rail replacement transport , even don@@ ors of the railway customers could get to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , there was a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without han@@ di@@ caps . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were dischar@@ ged on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall off , but they had a delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help mi@@ tig@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causing stomach cr@@ amps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote a tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lieu , if the same system is also present in humans . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which , however , had not had this . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequences , and six species of bacteria were found in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice . &quot;
mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria developed on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as the in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in food of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells like mice , and that most of us will protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira have mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later to be ready .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u launched in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent in this week revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wished three other new commitments , but insist@@ ed that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have gotten much trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State Mich@@ ig@@ an and with@@ drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new civil contract for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social @-@ democr@@ at prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fires from the Central Party , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - was the most important wish of the electoral warri@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch with increasing horror the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot;
there were failures .
and one after the other .
the Federal @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens party led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election his red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apost@@ ate Dutch Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U is a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jacket must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister of Business and Freedom of the Gre@@ ens to the Editorial Board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; that must not be true , &quot; an SPD election warri@@ or si@@ gh@@ tens , when on Friday morning the new ob@@ scene message reaches the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to the CD@@ U , without their own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no more , did the comrades re@@ assure at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why it became - and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the mar@@ row , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te smooth@@ ed the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously til@@ ting up in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had just launched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived . &quot;
and with him came the next heart@@ beat .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in the crisis communication he made quite everything wrong after that what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust system and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the criticism for some time now . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in the past few weeks , Wei@@ l always tried to set acc@@ ents in the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand its power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant that they promised a stabili@@ sation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal constra@@ int of the lower @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; from time to time , comrades , therefore , try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ life@@ jackets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mrs. T@@ life@@ jacket puts her own career interests on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs T@@ life@@ jackets has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but has been elected to Parliament via the national list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group &apos;s faction , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &quot; willingness to vote four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD to the German Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U MEPs wi@@ dens the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he requested to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
conveyor gel@@ ders for the city &apos;s core III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives informed urban development on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what was happening so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sensitive refurbish@@ ment areas .
&quot; back then , in the refurbish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the period from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to also promote interior development , and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ ation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which € 500@@ ,000 would come from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how does a renovation area develop ?
&quot; one will , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler further investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area in general . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the cellar presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; where the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the renovation area would then finally be set as a statute .
&quot; the funding period for the funding is ongoing since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; until September this year , however , it would first be possible to take stock of stock , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation field to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , it is planned to take place as soon as possible , in order to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Commune has to carry out the said preliminary investigations . &quot;
it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic ab@@ norm@@ alities and decide when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a san@@ itation note in the land register .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; Building and Property Ar@@ cs &quot; , &quot; where , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information about the size , distribution and occup@@ ants of a living room can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arc &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , first grin@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; one cannot reserve money funds for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; center II &quot; &quot; were shown to &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; the present . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a micro@@ chip im@@ planted with cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the shipping costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to military information left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior official of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , a helicopter from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forklift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Office required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , Deputy Commander of Navy for Aviation . &quot;
the message showed that on 17 July the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus for reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential jet . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently carry out training flights in the Washington area and in the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers accepted the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
Si@@ kor@@ sky spokes@@ man said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D will be 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are made in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to emphasize that .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter car . &quot;
at the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ ook with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss ki@@ cks off at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V in Kiel .
&quot; despite the five games being still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent in any case .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; right on the rear positions , I find the team very good . &quot;
imports from the high North are mainly due to the class and stability of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to assignments at the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ fjord ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult for us .
you also need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; if the Fren@@ enger event at the Italian Bi@@ ella plays an active Fren@@ ch@@ man not to the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament will be the first in this season . &quot;
the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should also be involved in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ us@@ z could again be back in the team . &quot;
&quot; for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the junior @-@ world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , one does not fill up the cad@@ res from the trainer by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tightening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the Congress packed a few un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels spro@@ uted against U.S. advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , since then , investors of the domestic O@@ MV are concerned , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East Stream 2 Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ one is phenom@@ enal .
&quot; however , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp himself would have to impose the sanctions on executive order . &quot;
there are twelve weapons of choice .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at what the Group could resist , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars K@@ iller , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A focused their attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state hol@@ dings and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican compound , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on 1 September .
roll backwards : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the watch is turned back in the urban day@@ care centers .
&quot; on September 1 , Kre@@ feld will be taking over food supplies in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) in self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the Department of Youth Wel@@ fare , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
the food is still cooked except the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh boiled cooled .
&quot; the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last kit@@ ten year there were 28@@ 00 children sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children who are taken care of 45 hours of the week , in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care , if children stay until 2 pm . &quot;
&quot; 46 part @-@ time workers have kitchen service from September 1st : they warm up the delivered meals , supplement them around salad , raw vegetables and fruit , propor@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean away , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ch@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as sevent@@ een units - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; they are much more involved , and it is easier for the administration to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
it is also about healthy eating and cooking .
children should help prepare meals .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; in addition to the quality improvement of kitchen performance , this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and third @-@ party lending for the city . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re @-@ tuned . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so heavy for around 750 persons in the training area , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; said Hay@@ som , Vice @-@ President of the Mission of the United Nations , said hundreds of women are running in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can be really representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international fighting actions to a consult@@ ative role . &quot;
&quot; this year , for the first time , the election will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3.4 million voters are registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stood up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the offen@@ ders tried to grab the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot;
&quot; without loo@@ t , the duo escaped . &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie has long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow among managers of bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ a site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which besides other products make hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that workers and trade union representatives would &quot; experience first &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company director of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called for &quot; concerns to express that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot; &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ a from the General @-@ Site Manager is deeply concerned with our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross first received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will react directly to this because we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and in@@ secure economic climate , continually review our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ a site , especially in production lines and operative improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ a as a production facility fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave after leaving an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release cl@@ auses , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record raid ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has imposed its way outside although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans board that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago from this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has intentionally revers@@ ed a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused damages of more than 200 Euro to the fair@@ ing of the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot;
police witnesses are looking for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the lead plan . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was travelling with his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au a car met him in his lane , so that he had to ev@@ ade to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the lead plan . &quot;
Sach@@ impair@@ ment arose in the car .
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , over@@ took a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident report , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver did not notice the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the caus@@ al vehicle to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen - Report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ die , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in front of the German press agency , he anticipated from the former Regensburg bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ fied Pope Bene@@ dict XVI . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the Catholic Church &apos;s reputation very much , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false assessment of the processes at that time . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican daily &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that reports on violence in Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were measured with &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regards to the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ ker@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; says Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation : &quot; &quot; we &apos;d like to go to the church and that &apos;s a f@@ aint eating . &quot;
she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; strokes were a quite normal ped@@ ago@@ gical tool &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one .
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports of mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; totally wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg as a lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and mental violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was also more violent . &quot;
&quot; however , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims estimate that many victims appreciated the overall humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence on protective cases at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became hand @-@ grab@@ bed by the latter if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musi@@ cally brought no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is all about it at all . &quot;
he is dedicated straight to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can reproach him from having heard about it too late or have taken the first indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , in which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s broad majority share an excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets on a regular basis and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion that led to floo@@ ding .
&quot; the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also put ear fi@@ gs on the hair or ears , he himself admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the same period of time , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
one wonders whether it is not more of his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media just fell on him .
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e many people , who have never understood it , are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot was reported about the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said an affected person on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is nevertheless that most victims are silent from shame .
&quot; if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ers , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student said : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ yers have opened more penet@@ r@@ ably or more clearly or rather than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust@@ worthy teachers , etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment entrusted him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak about any complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or brought to the public . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former dom@@ aine master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is precisely separated : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents of the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys were literally sh@@ ed@@ ding and portra@@ yed by sa@@ di@@ stic teachers , were all ex@@ propri@@ ated at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have reigned . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , as most witnesses stress , the theme of &quot; primary school &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the overall humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in this way , at most the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently dev@@ ote his ears to the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties were banned in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , they ex@@ propri@@ ated in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where the people affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he always had a look .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the official punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards to the time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians speak of the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of assessing the past in accordance with today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right .
&quot; but of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able and also not for what has been ban@@ ished in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the ordinary . &quot;
this is all terri@@ bly aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be worked out .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , i.e. to hold ear fi@@ gs and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his time in Regensburg , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , has shown in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ m @-@ Sent@@ ence also come to the fore ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , from his perspective , because the cathedral @-@ cats played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not deny that he led there a stric@@ ter regi@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; but this too must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally famous Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one doesn &apos;t even make a big singer from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and before every success , just in which area , still discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of person did you see Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart@@ felt person , of which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only lead a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with him , like many former dom@@ es still today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read him , he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly with them , are thus un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which she still looks and which she almost rever@@ e . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything you submit to him are educational methods , which were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves the burden of it . &quot;
&quot; now the lawyer would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its , and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
