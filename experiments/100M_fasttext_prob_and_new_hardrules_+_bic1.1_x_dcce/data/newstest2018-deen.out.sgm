<seg id="2">"an Irish-Anstalt, where young people meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the erstwhile basis of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official Munich map promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everyone who had to get upset because the Auto-Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historic maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoporta Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but especially very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called primitive signs, were incorporated into cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian surveying management, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops crossed the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was the current neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide Bayern-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The datasheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of earlier / today is most impressive, for example, the state capital."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was made 21 years after the map was created, so in 1877, as the Munich city district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered plots from the so-called" "Urs" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels present no more farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" at the tavern "or" on the air "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 there was the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Auer Lüften". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with King Ludwig II's death."</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "he was advanced for his time and ended for example the Ankases of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he has also forbidden the personnel to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was room first, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point also this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk renown in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatric atriums."</seg>
<seg id="40">"at the site of the former Auer Anstalt, youths meet in the Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"the football field of the TSV Munich East lies west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as" "main square", "the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs broke many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn track."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the sliders, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, urges afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special care when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, rapid-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and noted here," says the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to win discriminations, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately targets minorities, prompted the group to release the warning," "said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, which happen to people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will be stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist violations against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken prisoner by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report of the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office, which is shown that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People have to be ready whether to bring money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a Travel Warning for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws which obligate local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing village Weidezvn-Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary separators Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the right-wing graveyard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 dairy cows and as many young cattle and accommodated in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest milk" "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows, so pivoting."</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales can be found on the table of the Feriengarten.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischbach, he described the electric fence project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profit on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green land care for a lot of work, much has to be handled with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and took possession of it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it did not lead to bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the land could be extended quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operation," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticized because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs of 71 500 euros were supported by the leader, a quarter contributed to the Municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fences."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job without farmers or landlady."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiß asserted that" here, best foods are produced. ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landschaftsprayguideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state-of-the-art support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presupposition is the presence of a conveying system described by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be flippery (inclination more than 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the 2018 fishtail subproject 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the area of conservation measures 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans like every other - therefore the carefully orchestrated downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitages would have dyed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took the meaning of it, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to talk about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it concerns the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, the elemental waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable litter" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">"this conflict, because of the significance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America."</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a classical metaphorical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls no one, but rather an early Neoconservative, who brings the American flame to the umnachged world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, elemental, but hopeful people after long and often awful journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch shall not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two Scots belonged to the Team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the United Kingdom's athletics division, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship cadres will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special develops in Scotland" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain speech was incredible," Black says. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, which Eilidh brought quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads on this road and has established five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about Team Chapterin is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me, it makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the activation of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked at the critic, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 persons who have voiced their opinions on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"this is why the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum, is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just true people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also don't appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are regarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor's staff referred to as" "concentrated spam-attack", "others would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"President Trump is accused of Twitter users, blocked by his Twitter feed."</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-recorders were beating on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Jurica, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes to enjoy home comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="232">"over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer."</seg>
<seg id="233">Scientists from the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital (UKE) came to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking a year," said Director of the Heiko Becher study director. "</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he approached his own study on this subject from 1994."</seg>

<seg id="241">"traffic, which continues to hinder construction work, represents a major problem for the construction of the company Stumpp."</seg>

<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public raising in front of the occupying troops."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, stemming from the independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea the eastern part of the island."</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua with the Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta:" "Indonesia still holds a democratic system and there are free media, making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights abuses."</seg>

<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua people say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," "says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council."</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants the Paniai people to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is found in poor education and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobi says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a" guilt "that he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai victims offered a last symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station."</seg>

<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk will first reveal another, less glamorous figure for the first time: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk has often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="425">"Musk is now dreaming: 63,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is about a deadline, which expired on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground level ozone."</seg>

<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was accused of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly forced to block or delay regulators to resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruction regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA caretaker had exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turn-around in ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen was invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius station is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters Tumblegens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 St. Hilary's Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Land Registry: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen, with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the document, on the Hill of the Hill, apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard with which the church or the patron saint belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today in the town-picture of Tumloops are still to be recognized, the" mountain "the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are setting up these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied it with a priest remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit the church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was associated with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greatest of the two were torn to Christmas in 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be emitted later in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell parts were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">"they removed the pulpit and the church mill, and used it as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hilary was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's eight in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius system as successor to Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tumblegens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilary's chapel."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The suburb Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 16.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius station which is of importance for tumors and listeners.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim distances itself" "does not see any legal requirements for the construction and therefore has turned to the councillor."</seg>
<seg id="506">"the association" Boisheim, "has called upon Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border of Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"a few days before the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a malformation."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval of approval remains illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "in this place, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded."</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to current proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argumentation of the" Boisheim "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large grounds."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of around 11 400 households are to be covered - equivalent to one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen's city council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a shareholding in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg region."</seg>

<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experience in preparing with the triple-chain than with the four-chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how to act in Aue," "says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is convinced of his cause," "because we have just in the three-chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gißelmann players who can build good," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we do not afford such a lot of playing mistakes in the construction."</seg>

<seg id="875">"I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely for a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing," "says the internal defender of Fortuna."</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, guests from the Rhineland come as a light favorite on Sunday in an encounter at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep it away just because we are entitled to come under the first six, is stupidity," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish Authority of Forensic Medicine (RättsMedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they are to make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish migration authority (Migration verket) has been criticized for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were age-old."</seg>
<seg id="887">"until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>

<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in statistics of the past few months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said to the magazine The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases which suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older."</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars World Record Transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organisation controlling the European game has the power to forbid teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG must prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without big losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of their contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars in the face of the funding of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be countered with legitimate revenue streams, which enable them to break the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election for the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that associations, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP moved from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP creation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly enhance the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the proceeds for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time 82 million dollars) which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs seeking to overclock its financial supervision by inflaming its revenue by companies, connected to the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be counted as legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsor was added by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar WM ambassadors will be ambassador and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to follow any attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time would be scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd lobster (it contained an original story for a promising young vegetables, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by getting stuck on the core of the day - middle-aged actors play horny children, who will grow up, they still managed to win the last part of the Witzes."</seg>

<seg id="1190">"at one point, a character sticks through an Apple-Powerbook, some inline skates and" a number of other things from 1991. ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>

<seg id="1196">"it is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sublippbart of" Singles, "whose former big-man-on-Camp Andy is now feeling like an old cracker."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"these are the moments of accidental madness that could make this franchise as a kind of repetitive" Seven Up!

<seg id="1206">"there are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was edited on a lower length, could better supply its agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers. "</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in hitting the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects, such as the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 defendants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years old and had already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"in addition, officials established large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">"in the same period of time, two persons were arrested in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"against the two suspects Italians, there were German arrest warrants."</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two will therefore be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">"in total, more than 300 policemen were in use."</seg>
<seg id="1220">"Mafia's members are accused of criminality, violent acts, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail."</seg>

<seg id="1230">"deficiencies in the data recorded there may lead to some serious misdecision in the case of asylum procedures and deportations," warned in an analysis that the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" had received. "</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to data, ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data has not been adequately maintained, the data quality has not been good in parts so far."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"data from 1921 was found in individual cases," of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register. "</seg>
<seg id="1235">"faulty data entries can slow down reversal processes," "says the report."</seg>
<seg id="1236">"in the statistics on a sufficient number of people, EU citizens are also included who do not have to leave."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"such false orders, however, led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient taxpayers," says it in the analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children, if they have entered the country."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have subdued speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish when they retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members reaching an increase in this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and expected to continue for 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they signalled that in the next few years, interest rates would be necessary to raise the inflation-heated inflation from the Brexit and said that the credit costs could possibly rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic stimulus package issued one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the next February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecast of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to strain consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the rate of interest, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required for cooling inflation and a" somewhat larger "scale than the markets are expecting."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that increases would be" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and the next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast projected in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The Pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The Pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of interest rates and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% to 0.3% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is likely to recover slightly towards the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening is getting worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that in the next few years, monetary policy cannot" "prevent incomes", "but she added that wages can be" "recovered" "at the end of their three-year forecasts."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote causing the sinking of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy fully.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers in July demanded an increase of 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation in the last month decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said it was expected and will put it on again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2% was" "entirely" "attributable to the weak pound."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montale, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for businesses looking to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market looks very good for those in which the existing deals expire and the new mortgages are completed, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe 10,000 people controversial HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle in front of the High Court against the funding of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) taken before sexual intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial following the Supreme Court judgment last year, confirming that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this as" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prep prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV-preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission at risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics are identified to identify suitable participants, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the overall potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, which is targeted and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">"it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of humanity's greatest health challenges." ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, targeted specifically for vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one having a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">It is now important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former farmer with a passion for real estate, declined in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne said. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely refurbished."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other, without the need for mosquitoes."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering work went there," explains Erfan from the steel-strengthened, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is weighty, so it slips very easily when you push the door."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the soil."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that touch you and which therefore help create an emotional attachment in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they don't play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a debate on one of the largest real estate investment in Victorias worth more than $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be split."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with their mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns the value of $316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I was holding for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claimed, had excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but raises Paul to manage some possessions incompetently."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeansshop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, whereas Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark are, so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has held back very much although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS, to say" I can really not say much, "because the case is in front of the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and to draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict," "he said, adding that he is still hoping for a solution."</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a smooth course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff at his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television reaches decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," "said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February vis-à-vis Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habits under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media use includes a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter custom ever was "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about - that Trumps tweets without their intervention would have contained even more ignition material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are continually trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisers, the president for strategic reasons, to provide doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that it is getting rigidly to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone reluctantly rejected a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be" the source behind a pile of leaks "at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of chicanes or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the trash ram."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof you will find Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is taken from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on 1st March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Birkenhof hotels by the then ambience of operating company ltd. april 13, 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also income from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of more serious prospects at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group of Luisenhotels, managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof, there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovations are made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is remodeled, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "nicely bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated downtown level, Scherer stresses."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 guest rooms, wants to spread widely, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businesspeople should feel at ease in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to decide exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the outer complexes are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Issuer sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee received the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "with regard to the persons entrusted to the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper received the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The sender CNN reported that there are already first pressings of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us secret services accuse the Kremlin for a longer time interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller studied whether there were agreements between Trumps electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand who acted as advisers of the republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more Trumps in a private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post, "a few weeks ago, wrote that the Sonderer Trump was personally put into the centre and accused the accusation whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in potential crime cases and decide whether to raise charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called ankle buntings.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be powered by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite people to the hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the sender CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"besides Trump Jr., Trumps counsellor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his son-in-law Paul Manafort took part in the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the translation show that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work, and that he should act quickly if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on an accusation."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme gives the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"however, they usually work in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not to be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was called in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been employed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump were loud, he had to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, Comey told a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the National Security Adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation on whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired up by the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators set forth draft laws on Thursday, after which the special mediator could no longer be dismissed as simple as possible."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg from the almost seven-fold size of Berlin is solved by the horseshoe."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, which weighs more than one trillion tonnes and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with its length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the downfall of the iceberg is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, for some 30 years, however, there have been a series of unusual clashes of ice snuckles in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facet background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and breakage was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete cowshed is crumbled there, AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shelf cowardim is in danger, as the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-plate can be under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and push ice as much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small degree, the British research project writes on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data, the Larsen-C shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists are arguing whether the Larsen-C shelf should grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-foils of the Antarctic Peninsula have crumbled over the past decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore tines to the areas where the temperature rises at the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include an education offensive, call CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a real" "competition of public employers". ""</seg>

<seg id="1572">"people want all the possibilities to be checked, which allow an exit from the municipal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a house tariff," said nations. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in doing so, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually envisages the public service's tariffs."</seg>

<seg id="1580">"" "Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "said Minister of Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organization 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked together effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express himself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, saving human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only assess all accusations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that the crew aboard hoshouseboat migrants, who will be delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can shut down so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was said to take place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must especially have an Italian police officer who oversees their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize winner organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy following the rescue measures in Italy has declined dramatically over the past few weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1602">The first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for the long trials."</seg>

<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also been recognised by the first Bundesligavereine which are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"e-sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses, such as increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years were subjected to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June due to negligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and down-directed eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has not shown any remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she totally regrets."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their" age "or ripeness or even their mental illness will have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy who said that there is "no day in which I am not behaving the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for eternity despite all my pain, which we will bear for eternity."</seg>

<seg id="1679">"no longer the only person I have been together with since my birth, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to demand another commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, get up yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>

<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter attracted attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should take advantage of any press from the event.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked very well."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet in Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the Reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's wage list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no resting period of violence, and as the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treasured."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we urge all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelve River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of studded, two-level mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have annoyed the children, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was not to force Valdez, after confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter in 2003 when he joined up with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US-Dollar shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without hitting the drug problem, "Bojorquez said."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper served a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for their courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of CPJ. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curl like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there always at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love for the routine of his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their home starting and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrongly, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" Smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is done with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside we were looking for two policemen protecting against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were mandated by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-range neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some reporters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce gave birth to three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belongs to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El Flaco" "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on footpaths and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them circulate because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked for her to be re-divided by the government because she is worried that her fury has injured her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a society that is equally valid."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media guard group "Articulo 19" last year accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note, allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartell:" here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue how El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who, in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, indicates that drug trafficking makes him scarce."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became a reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sum up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with riveted rivets and security forces near the Mazatlan beach had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continues escalating as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the curb edge, they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a glance at the policemen who held guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"when they were afraid, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day when Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue though a frightening one.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinoceros of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even realize that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had something of a" "restless past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the reserved armored dinosaur "ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preserved condition has startled researchers who describe it as" "really remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to National Geographic reports, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that these herbivores, although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, is likely to be threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the nodose-dinosaurs made headlines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to the fact that the dinosaur was driven by sufficient pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution would favour the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals who use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which signals that this nodose-carrier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores have been the cradle," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life, including his preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, came into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time, Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative flaky skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as much today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just slipped a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretan Age was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, million years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six ton heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal" Current Biology, "believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the dusty armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin-stallions still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread to the top."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it is still on the street," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive in the evening later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police and people crying out, and by a man who claimed to be Brown's father who bore a shield with the inscription:" Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman assured his gun and cried," "I will kill you... animals all kill." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," says Ferrell to her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we get used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas after the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance which consists in the view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell, with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had" "had the black experience and the black state" "countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are going to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a climax of what has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience an anti-latent racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would make her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local stockholder who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in Organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community benefiting from their pain and resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt's occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people will be presented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrara's experience - to show that the movement" "is not a messiah guide, but a community that is coming together," "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris's life, how she fell in love and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin, marked the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media in 2012, identify as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement really is held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not by chance, although it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she clings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went into Ferguson three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though they are not built for a long time yet.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall on the southern end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme is hardly cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery:" "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "It would be awesome" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "don't need a man" "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "megalomania!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build a gallery to attract more customers to the city, as the rest of the shops will benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct will be bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot in which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction work, it will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda place with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the farmer's market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes made by the landlady again and again very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's ei for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is that too.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But this might not be very low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "why shopping bag in Bitburg?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but as there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store stores are rented in a shopping mall only from larger firms, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"as a pity, specialty stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where is the farmer's market hall to go during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, doesn't need anyone."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - how I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"once the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which resemble almost imperceptibly - hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst purged a 35-year prison term after she publicly publicized diplomatic news about WikiLeaks's website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwife and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA derived from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time, and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal bricks, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Suppressed Images", "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which President Chelseas verdict would convert and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"Obama actually only few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also a low and heavy battle at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to flames the stubborn divisions that he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to" automatic fragmentation, "based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence, a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic-novel mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how they appear in the hands of the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they turn up your speech, then they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulator, which unite like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also goal-oriented as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind her liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nation-wide human chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are considered suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Laa (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the acts of the Local Court of Cook County."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A Community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the event and detectives investigate the bulks as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Laa has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Laa had now been evaluated and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal affair that is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University collaborates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman at the University and the Somerville College told in an e-mail statement that" "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help US investigative authorities in every conceivable way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have a vision of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities will help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2179">"Grand Plaza's management team published an explanation to the residents:" "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible home incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">"said Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA)."</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of meeting the requirements of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in co-operation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-establishment of USADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren for alleged stately funded doping in Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation, because our anti-doping system has made a mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the execution of doping controls in Russia in November 2015."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping (UKAD)."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"after a visit to Moscow's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving" in the right direction "in order to be deployed again."</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"responses were often vague, little helpful or - worse - fraudulent."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"and even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed."</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company which shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which managers have low consent results - so that you can pursue why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"for start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the resourceful let's Talk Payments website."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect poor behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"like Glint, Convercent companies can send tailored" pulse "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline where staff can report bad behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the chief executive is involved, complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"when a company finds its employees poorly treated or behaved unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints," Quinlan said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">"ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to prosecute the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now that the company uses Convercent, problems that previously were hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair internships."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">"companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the Arthur Andersen accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"for a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break."</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finals on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three trainings of UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the fry shifted the start of the camp almost a week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during Moras held six playing times in Westwood."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its comfortable seat in the Guardian River Valley in Kent, and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England" spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkerwicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg. "</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s, who worked for the Jacobins, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "this is his thumb-print!"</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it was there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who is so beaten with old papers, that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle (" To be honest: I have overrated my welcome pit "), it all seems too beautiful to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" "new" "castle exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey "and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only gaining full access in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years, "in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. ""</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all his way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit patter that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century portrays his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" the gentlemen seemed to be a crook, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford. "</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crisis by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise within."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the area of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been retracted by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile-preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 persons involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a" "gift of God" "because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the Armed Forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But Erdogan actually has the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the" Hürriyet "newspaper published an article titled" Unhairy in Military Headquarters. ""</seg>

<seg id="2354">The big part in the army and the security forces continues at any rate.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan ordered another 7395 military servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan was tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they cast their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his victory in 2002, Erdogan pressed the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is driving purposefully an Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "a particular non-appointed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt from persecution in foreign countries, the Turkish army will be" full of extremists and salafists. ""</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey when he released his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adjust" "his robot accordingly to his convictions, selecting everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, who conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible," enthuses the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, it also has its moods - like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the allusions to rape, if one goes a step on Frigid (is here: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one of the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his site True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR appreciates their increasing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is transpiring from the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots will appear at a time in which women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has bounced to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most scary aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphical images, the loosen body and the stamped eyes, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that points to independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the articulation of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump's great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions, which have polarized US voters, have also split families in small format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's choosing relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all are supposed to strain all of us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The power of Trumps to bring families together was less noticed.</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a left-right poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the Republican relationship, with which she struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it seems to me in another context that this also entails significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the acting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and Trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that his bibs should not be repelled one day."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urgical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild criminal."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump passes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park's carousel, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>

<seg id="2536">"the place is already advertised - however, suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker has been City Engineer."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, he is surprised that no application has been completed so far."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for architects or civil engineers at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, under consideration of regular periods of notice, there is still plenty of time to prepare for it."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach is responsible for the administration's community as a subcontractor, the applicant must present relevant degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they could no longer complete them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but proximity to citizens is important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, looking back on the hackers with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is sure about the Bauamt and its staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">"however, also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen parkplatz are about to be encountered."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the zigzag bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still subject."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will make a book with about 1.5 million euros," "If we do it right," "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is plenty of room for a town building master."</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslach's own yard and gardening you can react very flexibly on a lot.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection ensemble, it is important to" have an eye for what fits "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing mayor of the city emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the mayor of the town bears high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," in the end everything goes through my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"in terms of care and coordination, he can count on many years of co-operation: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wants:" we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and staying with the place. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if you would like to be buried by Roland Wacker, you should have completed an completed academic studies as a diploma engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of Construction and Construction Law."</seg>

<seg id="2565">Bicycle on lines thrown: South-way route closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) to the lines."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"close to the crime scene, a rosy scooter and a bike rider were watched by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a kingdom of Lusatia," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have brought themselves in great danger, endangering the train traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay and the cost of the rail replacement transport, even donors of the railway customers could get to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"overall, there was a" substantial "sum," said the spokesman. "</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without handicaps."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten people were discharged on Friday morning, two of them concerned the long-distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall off, but they had a delay."</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help mitigate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causing stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote a tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieu, if the same system is also present in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which, however, had not had this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA sequences, and six species of bacteria were found in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria developed on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as the indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in food of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice, and that most of us will protect L. reuteri in our gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri."</seg>

<seg id="2631">"this shows once again: red-green can simply not govern reliably," said CDU-Secretary Peter Tauber, the German editorial network (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising fraction of a Greens party led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the Parliament election his red-green coalition thus lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-German Managing Director Michael Kellner called on the apostate Dutch Greens Elke Tlifejackets to return their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU is a clear falsification of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tlifejacket must immediately return its mandate," "said the Federal Minister of Business and Freedom of the Greens to the Editorial Board of Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"that must not be true," an SPD election warrior sightens, when on Friday morning the new obscene message reaches the party centre. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transition of the green deputies of Elke Tlifejackets to the CDU, without their own government majority."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>

<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus at that weekend because he was sitting in Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning."</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in the crisis communication he made quite everything wrong after that what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"because of the VW exhaust system and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the criticism for some time now."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese survey values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because, in the past few weeks, Weil always tried to set accents in the Confederation."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover, to expand its power in Berlin, did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz."</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant that they promised a stabilisation of the party from Weil.</seg>

<seg id="2662">"their anger is directed towards the Greens, and here above all on the backsliding parliamentarian Tlifejackets."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratic as Mrs. Tlifejacket puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," "says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"Mrs Tlifejackets has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person, but has been elected to Parliament via the national list of the Dutch Greens."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month, costs taxpayers according to military information left to the TIME magazine, up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior official of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"built in Connecticut, a helicopter from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi, built in Connecticut."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, Deputy Commander of Navy for Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that on 17 July the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "wrote the commandant."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "replied the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus for reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential jet."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" "Made in America" "- the products from all 50 countries which are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently carry out training flights in the Washington area and in the South Lawn to suspend US president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 performed 58 practice landings at the White House in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted at the training needs of the crew for the month, said an official."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew 11 hours this day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers accepted the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not run budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to Stundentarifen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D will be 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "determining the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is most misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week, which are made in America," Spicer said. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is appropriate to emphasize that.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a firefighter car."</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisndie, spokesman for the reform movement," We are Church, "declared after publication in front of the German press agency, he anticipated from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerified Pope Benedict XVI."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the Catholic Church's reputation very much, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the processes at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican daily" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised the fact that reports on violence in Domspatzen were measured with" two measures. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regards to the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful deeds, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikeran and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," says Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation:" "we'd like to go to the church and that's a faint eating."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that in her youth "strokes were a quite normal pedagogical tool" to cope with cheeky children as I was one.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports of misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the book" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg as a lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen was sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that in many cases by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and mental violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"however, unlike many other defendants, many victims estimate that many victims appreciated the overall humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen station Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence on protective cases at the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became hand-grabbed by the latter if a Domspatz musically brought no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is all about it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated straight to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school were also expropriated outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him from having heard about it too late or have taken the first indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, in which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of Georg Ratzinger's broad majority share an excellent testimony, described him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teacher, who provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets on a regular basis and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotion that led to flooding.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also put ear figs on the hair or ears, he himself admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the same period of time, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are certainly Bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more of his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope many people, who have never understood it, are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot was reported about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "said an affected person on behalf of the others," "Everything was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is nevertheless that most victims are silent from shame.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblers, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, to assume that... Buyers have opened more penetrably or more clearly or rather than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trustworthy teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report concludes with a clear result:" "that the students and / or their environment entrusted him in the run-up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak about any complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or brought to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link its good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violent excesses" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former domaine master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking out" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is precisely separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let's say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents of the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys were literally shedding and portrayed by sadistic teachers, were all expropriated at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, as most witnesses stress, the theme of" primary school "is taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the overall humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in this way, at most the accusation remains to be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently devote his ears to the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out," "that in the pre-school the test will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties were banned in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they expropriated in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where the people affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always had a look.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the official punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the" pitfall of anachronism, "that is, the danger of assessing the past in accordance with today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what has been banished in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the ordinary."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terribly awful and I am glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to hold ear figs and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his time in Regensburg, Georg Ratzinger, has shown in the conversations with you for the book" My brother the Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüm-Sentence also come to the fore?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, because the cathedral-cats played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not deny that he led there a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this too must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally famous Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone, one doesn't even make a big singer from rebellious boys and before every success, just in which area, still discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartfelt person, of which one can't imagine that he could only lead a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with him, like many former domes still today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read him, he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly with them, are thus unequivocally in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which she still looks and which she almost revere."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything you submit to him are educational methods, which were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that is behind it, too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves the burden of it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the lawyer would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits, and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
