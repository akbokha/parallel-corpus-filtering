28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local grocery store . &quot;
&quot; the brother of the victim said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , shared the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and investigations were underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who had previously worked as Koch in Boston , had caught his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; shocked and destroyed at the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia announced that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment he had a girlfriend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; to connect his family to his family was to always cook something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the flood .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information in this case is asked to call the SF@@ PD number under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; I will always be plu@@ gged in drawers or exposed to the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself have not the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of television with lo@@ cker@@ em de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she asks the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted at home in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and so the horse @-@ career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he let his family run over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ aid handed the man from An@@ hausen to the Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid in a small gala .
there is no shortage of awards to the symp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lor@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had bl@@ amed him .
the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the sport pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the double US master winner was added to the Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the runners belong to the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the cat@@ er@@ pillar Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Reu@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the show rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - we want Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two U.S. Pres@@ idents are un@@ aware of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to keep people small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wanted to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ting Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will drive back regulations mas@@ sively , and he is strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , Tru@@ mp and Clinton seem almost wor@@ rying . &quot;
&quot; the democratic candidate , however , announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot;
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so there could be party @-@ internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced .
Tru@@ mp plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ operate coal mining in the United States .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ onic trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , demanding around Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ ins@@ ist , then he says , he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , stands for boo@@ sting growth . &quot;
his critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to ask the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
fle@@ eing : &quot; every escaped woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized homes for single @-@ minded women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich women &apos;s aid . &quot;
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ating to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape are out@@ weigh@@ ed : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
some of the children are certainly not voluntary .
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big .
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodation just needs for them , asks B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich , some say no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in accommodation of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians , escaped women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in some Community homes , there are floors or own houses for single women and their children in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says , &quot; It is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together , there may be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the cr@@ ush , which is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since getting around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance in general strikes : demands for new work campaigns
assistant professors have called their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes over a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for his whole Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that it would have been appointed ministers to address the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the leader of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would be &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the contract . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC committee agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and challenge official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; responding to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board today submitted a formal proposal to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begins in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance physicians in this year struck six times , the first total failures in the history of N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the B@@ MA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 Assistant physicians and medical students , so that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , Health Minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be da@@ un@@ ting and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there would never be anything worse . &quot;
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to time was kind@@ led .
Putin told him and acc@@ using Ankara to fall back on Russia .
&quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was done by a supposed friend . &quot;
building up the vet@@ rain becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a heavy , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
&quot; the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clearly on the hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his ministry last month at a failed state coup .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved if the flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ de@@ mot@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the slu@@ g pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to take advantage of the cool sen@@ timent and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is clearly a matter of course for Moscow which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; once described : two countries that have been viol@@ ated and badly treated by the West , and are now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference saying that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State talk at least once more . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the brand R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don champion Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national stamps into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the IP@@ O are to be changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global objectives , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with our customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be the Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , as how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these stamps .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori at@@ tains its 3@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3@@ 000@@ th gain &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured his 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone at Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won against G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori records the che@@ ering when he reco@@ vers his victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two jo@@ ckey players reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger , had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 career prospects &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that it reached this milestone that only a few have reached before it .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which differs from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thrilled fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie has already won almost 30 years of winners in UK , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven , &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5 years old .
Russian Putin firing chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is stated that Putin had ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian president &apos;s administration without giving reasons . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Ivan@@ ov &apos;s substitute since 2012 , was named his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Estonian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the director and chief of Staff of the Regi@@ ment Staff .
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants of Vladimir Putin and worked as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff would return to his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced here - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at present .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man , who once was promoted as a potential president , wants to lead the Russian environmental policy once again - met with great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - post office posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian president &apos;s administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy . &quot;
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
&quot; once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , approaching ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced its termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal . &quot;
&quot; on the set , there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement . &quot;
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; for details on how the character of g@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is published , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , is expected to be released at a later date . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with it since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message released on Friday . &quot;

&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans one could wish for a series . &quot;
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish around Sand@@ als could act , which were sp@@ elled out by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
crossing Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ on cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Minister of Economy , Keith Brown , paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ on cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witn@@ essing an engineering skill from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; a total of almost 79 % of the total bridge deck at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first seal represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is a forward @-@ looking high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north side , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the land side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; mas@@ sively because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; delicate , as the tolerances upon which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they only amounted to a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men are lucky to be alive after they were thrown by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station ki@@ cked off on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat was moving on their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw the boat sp@@ un around us and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coast@@ guard and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened from the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
someone watches over these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic killer cut off his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes . &quot;
&quot; when he entered the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ erts its sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the street , she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds houses from Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken much more seriously in future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; Action Plan for Living &quot; at the next council session .
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the favourable apartments can also arise in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing development programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should ensure incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants to make even harder editions for investors .
&quot; no matter how viol@@ a , there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely up to date : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you look at the loss of some 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this happening , the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought out bonds from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to return the apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the West City .
&quot; at one blow , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; because in the West City , Fri@@ sten is running at the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dr@@ astically , one is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ fare . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social fe@@ eb@@ le in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; for a large majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
&quot; but what does not mean , however , that a compromise can not yet be found . &quot;
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children can no longer go outside for playing , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time at star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t mutually exclude each other .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture lost interest before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was displaced by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , shared the Washington Post recently with that within two days of market launch , the number of followed people who exercise every day 30 minutes , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for the performance increase .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; get away from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; active every day &quot; &quot; have strug@@ gled on de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
those who regularly drive sports reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also glo@@ omy game per@@ ish@@ ers who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk around a door . &quot;
what is it ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even when Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be delayed with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , more active and heal@@ thier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is im@@ mu@@ n to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now finally also the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast succ@@ um@@ bed to the multi @-@ fight title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team kam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es will compete on the Swedish beam during the multi @-@ stage competition of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title and , in total , the fifth , while holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was at an end in that moment .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; the last three years have dominated their sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast ever I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she expected her last test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight in@@ ale of women during the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future during their long path , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their land exercises - which includes their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a training flight into the gym , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition competition , a series of victories that will last for as long as Bil@@ ly wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led through two turns , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; ho@@ ur@@ ly beam and ground floor - in which , Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; again , with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the ste@@ am@@ bar again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured out at Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision she once described in her book book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her bottom @-@ up exercise she threw down the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in Phoenix since a decade , while chat@@ ting in the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting took the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in His@@ panic hab@@ itation within four months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting down half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge he@@ els and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like most of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder through which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I won &apos;t do it . &quot;
I don &apos;t create this .
I did not let myself into it .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her were told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but it is slow progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund mentioned for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to told C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on his own .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I didn &apos;t ask for the prog@@ nosis for a long time because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National weather service reported . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increasing . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service showed that additional 3 to 5 inch of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday as it ra@@ ined in the Mobile Area . &quot;
&quot; the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability gain record levels . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers can flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as the floo@@ ding flows only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State limit in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams continued to plu@@ ck people out of the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved in the vicinity of Glo@@ ves on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we are awake and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a major military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been completely absorbed by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and a lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a hit@@ ch went to Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches now both flooded .
&quot; the prot@@ ector of the community Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets , r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and provided sand bags for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their homes and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be flooded , but on Friday there were no reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; extingu@@ ished by bul@@ lets &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tells that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital during his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the station . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; prot@@ ru@@ ding bushes for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various storm @-@ guns , approached the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were sleeves . &quot;
&quot; so it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there have also been several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently re@@ port@@ edly reviews the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a lob@@ ster on her arm than she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
it reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine at the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at any summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three female gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon is round off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female attendance at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ as@@ tics was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected , but master@@ ly gy@@ nec@@ tic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sports classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ as@@ tics in the team . furthermore , the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i is a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily arise in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are uph@@ eld by parents responsible for training , training , travel , clothing , competition , and hotel costs ( for trainers and their trainers and their families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the municipalities a my@@ riad of young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible turn@@ out training . &quot;
I have founded my gy@@ ms of 20 years .
&quot; at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the wood of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance physicians would like to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 33@@ ,000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , H@@ unt had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
the first assistance physicians should receive a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend fees in order to improve care at un@@ ast@@ o@@ unding times .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Commission for Assist@@ ent@@ arians , said last night in a message saying : &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat the current workforce crisis and treat it to address all physicians . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes caused by discussions , in the government for reluc@@ tance to participate , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; this happened in a promise made by Jerem@@ y H@@ unt last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the worries of the assistance physicians . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to cover doctors at the Strei@@ k@@ post@@ enk@@ ette cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA aims to provide a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance physicians to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work campaigns reach nothing of little , but burden @-@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , pa@@ w@@ lers and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns of the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ stle @-@ pac@@ ing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other key issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were returning from professional training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - drug , which can reduce heart risk &quot;
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot;
the N@@ HS &apos; regulatory body has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS &apos; regulatory body has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the blood flow up to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots loose , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot;
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes electoral fraud in Muslim areas flour@@ ish
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was removed last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption removed from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report is revealed today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les deals verb@@ ally with the police , election observers and town@@ houses to have ignored evidence of electoral ab@@ uses due to &quot; &quot; crimes of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister for integration and municipal government , who is now an antagon@@ ist , said that intim@@ id@@ ation by voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabins in order to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a reference with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes not to apply removable inks to a person &apos;s finger when they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but is also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ ection Sc@@ andal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ zu Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had &quot; &quot; per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; &quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia alleg@@ ations . &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis of the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an imitation , in which one person chooses to be someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed an alar@@ ming effect on the frau@@ dul@@ ent postal voting - when older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system including guiding the ID to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; the report states that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ la@@ dic backgrounds . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; opinions about eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on political activists to process letter codes to stop &quot; &quot; harv@@ ests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is being considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list to be used for immigration and social bet@@ ting purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing according to your ID .
non removable ink can be used on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has handed down her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to perform to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter of letters .
ban on political activists to process full post@@ ings and envel@@ opes of post@@ elections .
the police have the authority to set up barriers to election stations .
&quot; a change of law , which was facilit@@ ated by an accus@@ ation of intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( National Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photograph@@ ing in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters go on their own in the voting cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ up checks &quot; of the election registration departments of the Town Hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The Jud@@ gment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears a proud inheritance as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; this week , fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to have gold fighting ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans who have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood &apos;s celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary similar .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see any great resem@@ b@@ lance , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a ben@@ evol@@ ent guy , so I probably summ@@ ari@@ ze it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons of London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her big , expressive eyes , is said to be a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ t@@ ress
&quot; another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nicely , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan has been attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
actually the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and face .
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons include K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese flo@@ ater died &quot; like a pig . &quot;
&quot; Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m , ou@@ ter@@ ned audience of the C@@ BC @-@ live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ hic Games on Wednesday &quot;
&quot; the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese &quot; &quot; Flo@@ mmer@@ in &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; depar@@ ting &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m breast@@ plate squ@@ ad@@ ron , he had to give off his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was taken on board in the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as I called M@@ ief , he died as a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing Ai Yan@@ h@@ ane , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer@@ in from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with many people talking to him . &quot;
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how in@@ sensitive Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets all of us look like sha@@ ves . # adverti@@ sed .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times among the people who responded to the Twitter via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have focused on the performance of the float , and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who in the middle of the business tried sham@@ elessly under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman drew her clothes in the midst of a mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ in@@ ised how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back on the shelf . &quot;
she continued to browse and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark store in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone where women tried their under@@ pants , before putting them back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ garments , &quot; she rose again and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out their own stru@@ mp@@ s trousers and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like as they put them back on the shelf .
&quot; she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moved and went out . &quot;
she did not seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants he had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home , who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson said : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the garments off the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman touched them and pulled out again and they were not washed .
&quot; Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against armed attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , you should turn around first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with his knee in the bar and turn , while the att@@ acker crow@@ s before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backwards while directing the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on your chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what it is in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to transfer your money , unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ uts his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and stran@@ gl@@ om@@ eration of a serious test - by le@@ aking some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places .
&quot; the present@@ er and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k threw his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button on a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
before the check of each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting into .
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to check the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a traction toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical experts on the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he le@@ aned , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public rail to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task put its immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he did justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample line showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to deny after its lumin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; That comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I won &apos;t check here because it &apos;s here disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian about , to bul@@ let them and others in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ ving social apartment in S@@ alt@@ amp , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a det@@ onation with a damage of £ 50,000 because she terrori@@ zed her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ hi , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were perfor@@ ated holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who were in the apartment temporarily and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive crying , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; old tr@@ ash was found in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood plan@@ ks were torn open . &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called to the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing vac@@ ated her and her partner this week by forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said : &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have been given the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the town house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ants agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ stration is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into consideration . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who courage@@ ously listened to us and gave us the information they gave us . &quot;
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ving on the ground
workers of the house administration will now have to cut waste mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after being guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial intent .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after being homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the building &apos;s walls were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will act ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told us that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ stration should be a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach , as well as to those who were har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;
tourists in Portugal in panic after an eff@@ ec@@ tual military jet beach is flying
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force placed an incredible crash
&quot; the Air Force admitted that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no risk of security . &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start panic after an eff@@ ec@@ tual jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal near the beach in Av@@ eiro .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up , when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle movements without first seeing what came through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deeply flew .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet was a bit deeper than usual due to poor visibility , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where there were also four deaths on Madeira Island . &quot;
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limits his vision
&quot; the airplane was on a training flight , where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup outside the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash exp@@ ires three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ ed@@ ner must refrain from playing with the sub@@ merged cup@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europe League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e of St@@ egen is missing . &quot;
&quot; in practice , the German suffered a change of lig@@ aments in the knee , which at least initially clari@@ fied the request of Bar@@ ca for the first time in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen resist the status as number one . &quot;
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique so far reno@@ unc@@ ed a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other competitions appeared . &quot;
before the first mandatory play of the new season there is doubt about the fitness status of the team who was humili@@ ated with 0 : 4 on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know yet at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ get@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
&quot; Sevilla , in turn , has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid to di@@ gest and asp@@ ires the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Espa@@ ña . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the world rank@@ ings ranked the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ ally Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ kun@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title one with each other .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches . &quot;
they had moved back to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests alone on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; the matches up to this point I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts were awarded the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points . &quot;
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; nevertheless , a sufficiently breathtaking ball change was to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ kun@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ rus@@ hing had a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , had become an Olympic @-@ fourth table tennis tournament . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &apos; huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now gave short@@ com@@ ings of his electoral campaign in U@@ tah &apos;s Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary vo@@ iced such concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having thrown up 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , there are now doubts about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilty of false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tru@@ mp and his competi@@ tor from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were consistent . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards , this will either be successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he does nothing other than telling the truth .
&quot; if it is not sufficient for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tru@@ mp continues . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party should have threatened to make money to support his electoral campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans want to take a stronger grip on the Congress . &quot;
Olympics : Tri@@ ster Frau@@ d in Dop@@ ing Test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee informed immediately to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , have handed down a pri@@ mal specimen under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich in the Olympic Village . &quot;
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own research into an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will conduct an evaluation , &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the Dop@@ ing Control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed down the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; said Kenya &apos;s Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete standing on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become world championship @-@ fourth more than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich had been dra@@ fted off the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money @-@ payments athletes of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested at his return to the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences , Kenya has been under special monitoring since a long time . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls launched by the IO@@ C , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio Games have been noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted . &quot;
&quot; the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics in Brazil , creating an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; in consequence , the WA@@ DA Ken@@ yan took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing tools are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in this sport , it could be proven that in this sport , it was ter@@ med and systematically supp@@ ressed . &quot;
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival is presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temples of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room .
&quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix and the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she remembered her love with Tony , while the younger Mary was playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly topical : &quot; in this piece , it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ kan@@ ers went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London school maid who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girl who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family found out about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria several weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the stron@@ gh@@ old of the group in the country , I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 17 , Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after leaving the war @-@ torn country and returning to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to deter people from ever taking this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London asc@@ ended to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .

&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .

he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .

Tre@@ ats aims to provide cervi@@ cal calendar for &quot; women and men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distinguishes , as Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the opinion that the calendar also does .
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nude in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of cal@@ endar@@ s . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it &apos;s a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; who does not suit and Erdo@@ gan runs , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ closest foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of asylum seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already over months passed over Kur@@ dist@@ an stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the beaten put@@ sch , there were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to start again in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees themselves , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of Represent@@ atives compl@@ ained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been exter@@ min@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the Chief of Staff called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is held against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;

&quot; as the newspaper reports on calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks already faced the biggest group of asylum @-@ holders recognised for political persecution before the coup in Germany . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore nearly 29 per cent of all as eligible as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum Rights in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from state page , individually prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country election will not be held again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid than hitherto it is not : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the champi@@ ons , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; the most holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen , or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so may not choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems arise : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang out posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end votes out , only ar@@ duous . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to let the people go over for election campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting is how much new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition @-@ du@@ sting .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors have cold feet and Chancellor Merkel will blame for the flo@@ wering of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create this , &quot; has accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you make election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Angela Merkel chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U does not wai@@ ve the usual election campaigns on market places and in front shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this means that co@@ co@@ operates , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union , too , has noted that on the land you will crum@@ ble the foundation so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the vast expan@@ ses of the country there are hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral fighter Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were last at 22 per cent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had yet clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday need and transfer their electoral campaign largely to the internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; she calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on the search for local vocal ch@@ ests among holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , is straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; voting holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 remedi@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
&quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is san@@ iti@@ zed , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and only end at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty much , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff about the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be postpon@@ ed to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; the award will also be the receipt of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of behavi@@ our@@ al journeys . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive on both sides from the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen .
the passage of cre@@ denti@@ als through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the technical management of the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ aks were seeking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ised .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the municipality insist@@ ed on strengthening the mass @-@ vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have been bitten .
the fastest was with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres in the speed @-@ 30 zone on the way .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become more cal@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; for business people at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurbish@@ ment has led to revenue out@@ breaks , everyone whom you ask is easy to see through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; course of course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local pubs along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants was &quot; hard hit . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue rose to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road marking stopped its operation &quot; two years ago . &quot;
half of his co @-@ workers have to be dismissed .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , the policy would have re@@ acted otherwise . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the inn would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , they also have to bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous was handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history . &quot;
that other regul@@ ars are now seeing less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance - he can understand .
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also very nice somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; that his stem @-@ client@@ ele comes back to the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
six months of construction work is brutal .
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly bol@@ ted to laws . &quot;
&quot; following recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a D@@ ul@@ ance Status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ver@@ ant .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , says the Federal Minister of Interior for the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in it .
&quot; but , as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wur@@ z@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has made a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and arms legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to impose sympathy for terrorist groups and push jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and also demanding nothing at the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation .
&quot; refugees , which are targeted in the country , should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; in the event of de@@ ferred asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are politically and legally sanc@@ tioned .
&quot; some of them are still un@@ plu@@ gged , and leaves questions open . &quot;
&quot; and at some point - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in view of the high refugee numbers , many people were worried about security . &quot;
and things that people deeply employed could not be cl@@ ung out in election times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral competitions . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly gaining position in the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , it went up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ sty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a departure from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not useful .
&quot; and with a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it is still necessary to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could cause quar@@ rels .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to benefit from the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes first cau@@ ti@@ ously readiness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still able to get off lightly .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery numbers are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action there is whi@@ r@@ l around a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
&quot; despite the diesel aff@@ aires , Europe &apos;s largest car @-@ car can continue to boast an increase in spite of the diesel aff@@ aires , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW declined , above all in Western Europe , and again loaded the total sales , as announced in the D@@ ax company . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries decreased by almost one sixth . &quot;
brand head of sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann returned the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets there has been a purchase rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around Turkey &apos;s attempted coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for ex@@ iting the EU also stressed a spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ industry first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to beech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the primarily affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is further off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , group sales Fred Kap@@ pler announced further sales of sales . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust gas tests with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the re@@ building of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not give any deterioration . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the car , the car is issuing a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in company travel . &quot;
reason are legal entities .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a guarantee for rep@@ aid diesel models .
this would have been confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
VW has fulfilled the requirements of my enquiry commission and the KBA .
&quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take place after retro@@ fitting , and all type approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was said in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop for half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , is to be safegu@@ ar@@ ded with regard to possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands rich savers in future pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , CEO Josef Paul said : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
the German banks &apos; association speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : normal savings would not be afraid to pay pen@@ alties for their as@@ par@@ agus .
&quot; banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; as of September , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is calling for private and corporate clients for deposits exceeding 100,000 euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 expenses will be € 400 in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; he held 40 million Euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to another , and which he could not exploit . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
I cannot lay down for every million euros .
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle , he will now pass the costs further . &quot;
&quot; leaving the cash in the treas@@ ury of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank executive . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the co @-@ operative association Bayern declared : &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing substantial costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; you alone bear , be &quot; economically lasting not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 with j@@ acks for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay fees for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; At T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is a bit more luxuri@@ ant by the fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if she is holding money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; is currently not known as any other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative is very high . &quot;
competition is hard and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in the l@@ atitude .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle aged love boards .
&quot; before you go to the comment section , to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ame men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ development of vinyl records is not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely group of buyers . &quot;
it &apos;s not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and gam@@ ble wild@@ ly before I stop , keep my hands and say something wrong as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind by observing .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I received from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : eight young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle @-@ aged , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when they appeared and once again buying items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vices .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are inspired to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have to get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took off the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that call happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is as a collector and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is an easy way to deal with spiritual things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff whis@@ pers out of a stack . &quot;
an IC@@ M survey in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably be very concerned , while I was browsing through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ ilers . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musical . &quot;
&quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly coming in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts his latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz ro@@ ls out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but the psychological trauma is hard to imagine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she rather makes a window @-@ shopping tour than a big shopping .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to give up the jeans under@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who think for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id Cam@@ eras , before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is the one who is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research has yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , do not take into account the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by panels , while they ste@@ er clear of the star@@ ing gaze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting men of middle @-@ aged . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer of demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to offer 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , sell hair services , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture has argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would be a risk of fire and san@@ itation .
&quot; humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people operating the 72 provisional shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated as useless and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants , on Friday , estimated that the number of living in the jungle camp was increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers in the course of summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time cycle , Rad@@ professionals Tony Martin is not willing to let go . &quot;
&quot; I keep going on the world cup at a glance , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I hon@@ estly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; Martin said . &quot;
he must analyze in peace the reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the time of the F@@ W in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed over the last few years .
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time world champion who had lost on Wednesday the 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes on the Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

&quot; as far as money is running for the tak@@ eover , Microsoft did not share on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ am started the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch others while playing , but also intervene . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give players up missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment . &quot;
the Player@@ Speci@@ fic Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
&quot; on the way to the global media event , Facebook is said to help . &quot;
the advertising industry is already listening .
&quot; the start @-@ ups , which has so far been based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , mig@@ rate to Microsoft Head@@ quarters in Red@@ mond , such as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in various federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers from the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed poli@@ sh@@ es , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for continuous measuring operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be tra@@ cked across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access restrictions according to time , driving strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ driven state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easily cl@@ apped , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also non @-@ safe outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information given by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technology : France has recently ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ star ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold fet@@ ches
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening , at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji awarded a master class in handling , side st@@ epp@@ ing , back , line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago they lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they only lost one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji began to be wonderful , and left the G@@ Bs &quot; attacks out of fun . &quot;
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 up , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au ech@@ o@@ ed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; a pre @-@ emin@@ ent T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a won a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ pu@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed down to the line to make a gate .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
that is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova passed through to a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ phi@@ sts , whose fans sang , wa@@ ving flags and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB had thrown out crus@@ hing in the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; earlier that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspir@@ es by fight with the trainer &apos;s Cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inous gold than in these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that goes into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning had an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; although there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she ru@@ ined the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without tax conc@@ ub@@ ine , the first women in the history of British sport that set such a benchmark . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written application , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference , and it was no one but the coach who didn &apos;t know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right term at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning to talk more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning who was the cent@@ uri@@ on in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . it might be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats just how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anyone , so a massive thank goes to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up with them .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very soon .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not expecting to make something t@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary clarity taken care of
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria &apos;s far exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the reason why some time ago it was in the original version of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
&quot; a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia paid tribute to the con@@ vo@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; was far from exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the co@@ er@@ board association , stands for 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; members of the congregations are the congregations of Kirch@@ ners , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brunn Ci@@ tizen &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as Water Ste@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Director of the Board of Justice in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency deplo@@ y@@ ments on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and repar@@ ation of farmers , the renovation of the high @-@ rise containers ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) , and the partial renewal of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and there have always been new additions , because water and drinking water are the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association in a real way as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised Aquari@@ us Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rup@@ ture of the pipe in Kirch@@ ners on a 3rd of January . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 .
&quot; the man called upon us and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after whom I am publicly punished . &quot;
meanwhile Sven S. could travel by car .
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man has a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon in himself , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being has been killed . &quot;
&quot; this is a mur@@ derer &apos;s crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Lighting for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed of additional costs in millions .
financial burdens threatened by the renewable energy sector are from the table .
&quot; the German Steel Industry Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) remains at the release of the Renewable Energy Revolution in the German Steel Industry . &quot;
&quot; I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations , we could finally reach it . &quot;
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to checkout . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works fall an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
so the status quo of the previous ruling is largely determined .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Stahl is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; on the Reform of the E@@ missions Trading Act , climate and employment objectives are also to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China cast massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers reject price dump@@ ing Chinese steel corporations .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has become somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , im@@ porting import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price is picked .
the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ rupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; at 3.4 million tonnes , it produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the manufactured quantity went back the second month in a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increase in output in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , mind , health : singing things sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she taught music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors @-@ choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures often dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand his lungs get out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life as well .
&quot; even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia are sin@@ king to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head is also required for special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially elderly people who live alone , do not only concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem increases by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : when I practise for a long time , I will better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can stop there when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader .
many sen@@ sing choirs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust did not let the males get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved equally in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the level of arous@@ al of cat bab@@ ys at the sight of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great trouble , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es were different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adults and eight female cats were observed from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens which were raised in addition . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the low sample , the researchers consider their findings to be meaningful . &quot;
&quot; all females , even those who did not yet have their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
&quot; they turned around faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls played off the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males ever re@@ acted , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises many times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski reaches Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted put@@ sch attempt , another important football match is taking place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even in the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , there is no stop before the football . &quot;
&quot; against the former Stark@@ ick Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the southern door living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ k@@ ür shouldn &apos;t be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is being responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency that has been handed down for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact that does not affect the lives of most Turks as well as no effects . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Turks at the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at the gala event &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; Cologne in the past season proves its sporty value : at 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; move out early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it only reached rank six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher King . &quot;
this is also the reason that fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez only borrow@@ ed from the Treaty of Florence had announced that it would not return after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country following his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario , however , wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; has quoted Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to reno@@ unce around one @-@ third of his estimated annual price to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was banned twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other over @-@ led athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the theme of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Juli@@ ja je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had su@@ ed her start right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly plu@@ cked out and bu@@ gged out at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it offered itself a bizarre scene : with a set smile , she was still proud in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst out into a jam @-@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , who are going to start the Olympic Games in Rio in spite of the dop@@ ing past . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had already been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after her taking the pain relief Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , world champion in 2013 and European Championship , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent , meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin , from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was locked for six months .
the four most far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , mut@@ ated Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ stein , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete had so many med@@ als later detected . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand the Olympic Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro title in 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also given back to the CA@@ S International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : world record chan@@ cell@@ or and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found evidence of the ing@@ es@@ tion of a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mild and was already running on 13 July . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the Foreign Ministry spokes@@ man , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in hospital , but had already left it . &quot;
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , had explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives came up again , according to the authorities another person was killed . &quot;
also Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
&quot; when det@@ on@@ ating near the popular seaside town Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police charges . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
finally they called for det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast several injured .
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to comment on possible motives , but it is probably the action of the Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not stand in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; a spokes@@ man said in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were laid .
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities would have kept secret indications of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks st@@ ole .
&quot; the police instructed their officials across the country to reinforce the security of important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the recent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry strongly recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applied to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ito and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , all necessary journeys are dis@@ cour@@ aged in these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution laid out by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this ad@@ mits a major influence to the military in the coming years .
&quot; j@@ un@@ ta chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody tur@@ mo@@ il , resist@@ ed itself to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; almost one year ago , in Bangkok , at a stop in a popular Hind@@ u Shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stroke of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; has been targeted at the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several national offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see clu@@ es for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic basic rules , &quot; &quot; said Chief Executive Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß der Deutschen Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
the &quot; identical movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine German states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely aligned with the local offices when deciding . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the constitutional controller . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for your own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to this .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , for this he had no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the &apos; Frei@@ tal &apos; group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorism groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers , refugee camps , or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were born on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; he expressed concern about the fact that many offen@@ ders went to the account of people , who did not appear before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying factor .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects on asylum accommodation have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated criminal offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts who , however , have radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist voting rights . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
&quot; not always , the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot;
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it could no longer be seen in the TV images . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral agent . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporting character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special starting right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more famous .
&quot; because in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ hale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; The Sun &quot; was funny about him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he took only a minute and almost five seconds about the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete on his own in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
at the time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before the Olympics for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ et@@ s@@ ried - The owner of a Lad@@ ens at the New Square has been fo@@ al .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ et@@ s@@ rie@@ der left their business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when they returned the next morning at 8 : 15 a.m. , 250 Euro had disappeared from the cash desk . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .

Tru@@ mp is not so close to the threatening election defeat
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp talks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp lo@@ oses US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either work , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not sufficient for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
&quot; he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post asc@@ ends to trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is apparently large .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
&quot; in short , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market as of the coming year .
&quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they want to sell their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to sell to other companies as well . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ board Jürgen Ger@@ ov had said that there are always questioning , such as tra@@ des@@ men . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon enter into the mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ factory production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 vehicles per year and layer . &quot;
Ger@@ sh@@ er announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and provide a complete conversion to eco @-@ friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we surround the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP guidance acc@@ edes after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the re@@ ins came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K let us know that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management stands the world &apos;s number five in the industry before a personal start .
the CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already leaves the supervisory body with effect on 12 September .
&quot; as early as September 1 , the management of the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ mark@@ inger , shared the company . &quot;
he is said to officially assume the function of a spokes@@ man until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found .
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy direction . &quot;
details did not want to call a spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be managing the market research company in the future is still unclear at this time .
&quot; in the revol@@ ving circles it was said that on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will become rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would also be the way &quot; , &quot; it was said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales fell by 3.4 percent to € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million . &quot;
&quot; the profit in the second quarter , above all , imp@@ acted the company &apos;s s@@ unken value in the face of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the corporate value of EUR 139 million , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , posted a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K generated consolidated net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into dit@@ ch in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n : eight viol@@ ins
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people have been injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach from the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her data , had to give her information to a vice vice , who drove partly on the reverse track . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency medical ambul@@ ances came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the last travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ten@@ e@@ berg 3.@@ 44 will take place on October 1 , 2016 for the area of sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ten@@ berg 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp , 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ locality , the wastewater fee will increase once again at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are required . &quot;
&quot; after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ zur@@ ro is then 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the household by the office of the office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ coverings have been installed for these sewage plants . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ te berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous period of calculation must also be compensated . &quot;
Schmidt founded the serious fee increases so that there were relatively small facilities at all three sewage plants with a very low waste water attack between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
&quot; for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the past calculation period of all three plants , refurbish@@ ment and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent on all three facilities . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ locality is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ tec@@ s sewage plant .
&quot; in the pumping plant Wel@@ ten@@ der@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be extended after almost 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional aer@@ ation facility was installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the continued support and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still far below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; full . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs at the waste water facilities in the past 20 years , had been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the view of stone houses , especially as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ eb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wer@@ age association could not be extended by these facilities because it concerns public defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria registers for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furnishings , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein . &quot;
&quot; the filters are non @-@ blo@@ ated , self @-@ locking tools that generate over 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps reach the public .
&quot; in the past , Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have criti@@ qu@@ ed critics in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face would promote or propag@@ ate white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when it proposed to some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage continued on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was meant to be a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; grace spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote in an e @-@ mail , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and the least unpleasant . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face was pulled into the out@@ going extrem@@ ity . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ed in the race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that ra@@ f @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the setting practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his associates , but according to a speaker , the company recently set up a personnel responsible who focused on sub@@ mis@@ sive population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , in turn , said that she is closing her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership distorted IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to record a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were permitted on the ground , a committee of enquiry held in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Defense Forces Committee , intelligence committees and the military budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence gathering , typically deter@@ red by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ de@@ es , regularly marked a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it would have permitted the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com extend to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detail@@ led problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government officials have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superior laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , Stat@@ ements and Stat@@ ements prior to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after it was played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights , while the investigations will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com Reports are being conducted by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a moder@@ ately limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Commission , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; sh@@ amed the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the de@@ mining information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush intended only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year the team headed for Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government agencies , finds that contrary to the statements by the government air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
&quot; the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is pending . &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; but that knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way that will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters play sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the ca@@ ster .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London which we now have .
we have been able to pull the helm all around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door row in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
&quot; India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled in the middle and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 guidance . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and ines@@ capable , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been well known under these known names , which are sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ sensitive TV advertising , if he is a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cing . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for Gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the fli@@ pper and may reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I want to make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ se that many of them , I asked , did not know that it is an Olympic sport altogether . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and has had an ath@@ lete , who has made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending upward pressure - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two types of sport that it essentially combines . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much like &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are rated according to the official &quot; &quot; Olympi@@ apro@@ gram &quot; &quot; by design , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympia @-@ ord . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel as ti@@ res@@ ome when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers an at@@ tire of it .
the vector of the trampoline jumping is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she bo@@ unces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. tur@@ ner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects its blowing , new fan community . &quot;
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen protest@@ ors were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that police fired and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable rate .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to lead the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ab@@ yss@@ sies . &quot;
all the youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a far @-@ critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies were the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den which have been more or less enforced in recent years and could arm and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of inf@@ estation under the surface now .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government obstruc@@ ts access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians made their way to the protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this too is changing .
&quot; we are co @-@ ordin@@ ated under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively op@@ a@@ que reasons to take Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of protests prot@@ ested against elections which , according to the analysts , were apparently fu@@ cked by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was over relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ use of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ ist city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his statement Obama has been founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ling that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton had been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication gave rise to new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
&quot; it also brings out his comrades who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful period , into the peculiar position , to explain statements he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement during an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp stayed back on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism is bo@@ oming down on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while trying to focus his campaign on falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this subject . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the linguistic fron@@ tiers in politics and then to call back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more estimated sound , as its survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ lead his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while strengthening the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he is saying are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them rear @-@ bank@@ ers , completely wrong , and so it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread aggres@@ sively by taking control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being round about each of his words and being accused of him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot ! &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s excuse as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once sold over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a bright coffee shop in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash that had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , due to the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front , it was super@@ se@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; so@@ aps Cher@@ ie , which replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local residents used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it &apos;s also new finding . &quot;
&quot; a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered him to provide cash for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez stated that he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ rul@@ ings such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural tears of nature .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez stated that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by the Willi@@ am@@ sburg pricing , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebec@@ ca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take her way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave up coffee for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they are preparing my Every@@ thing @-@ B@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still receiving his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez stated that he had no gru@@ dge that the soap shop took the old business area .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for verb to make with the coffee @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will continue to deal with it , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , also accepted the café . &quot;
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez stated that he pre@@ tends to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
CO@@ Es Last Book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while bricks in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; were told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
&quot; the latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixes ate . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ y , the couple found it fitting for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ uts , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inning .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; shows the ways in which the country was going to no longer be the land of Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget@@ ary was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and asser@@ tions became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of rein@@ forcing food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; when coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; different mixtures were tried out , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy food @-@ sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; like never before or since , household econom@@ ists , including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have dealt with the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa rural kitchen of his kitchen , he was fed as the million@@ aire man of the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to appro@@ ve an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the how@@ ling of a house@@ keeper with no interest in the tastes of Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said bricks , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple admitted the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; bricks were remembered : &quot; &quot; it actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a real trick to miss modest recipes a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone sw@@ ung a little reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E grab@@ bed three times a night .
&quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , had previously saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers are putting their own life into play to attract people from bom@@ bed houses , and to make their first aid in the war area . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil servant , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour saving of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four lap@@ tops over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
a woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ ra@@ e is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the basis of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a recipe for a high age . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long ago that Greenland will become st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter at the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
&quot; their slow @-@ motion @-@ tur@@ pent@@ ine measured it , when they cut six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; this sh@@ arks nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ic@@ e@@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers that tor@@ so out of higher water @-@ layers .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured .
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the core core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular core .
&quot; therefore , their birth was to lie after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons attempt larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ st , on the other hand , contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , which is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all major Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in its l@@ enti@@ l nucleus , which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers could even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k females only get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now researchers of the length could assign an old age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the reproduction are obviously at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ als live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ agus flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more danger@@ ously and should focus on as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more in a long life . &quot;
construction ground in a double pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the municipal council is focusing on issues relating to construction . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board took the notice of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently designated areas of residence can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ li@@ zation and clos@@ ings issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for survey could be made , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Road @-@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and calm residential community of Schön@@ au attract young families and rep@@ utable sen@@ iors in equal measure .
&quot; as it was said , the members of the community can immediately report to the Town Hall . the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also make inquiries for the settlement of other industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land usage plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area , which was already shown there , is expanded by two plots in the direction of the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; therefore , the city on the Main has the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very prob@@ able that Frankfurt profits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial markets may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been granted approval in the UK so far . &quot;
that is why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg conce@@ als a large fund industry , it is also worse in terms of infrastructure and infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city has easily available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the banks are responsible for first @-@ class commercial real estate by 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the Merc@@ er consultancy , the city is ranked 7th in seventh place in seventh place , in Dublin , in No. 33 and Paris . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , the economic researchers believe . &quot;
&quot; the correlation of forces : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C Patent case with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ str@@ ate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from compensation for damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other in@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , US Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a decree of the cost incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alise with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained about each other and took possession of laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ mo@@ vir was ground@@ breaking , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
U.S. supported troops say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops backed by the USA have taken full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left it , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters that have dug itself inside the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , Shar@@ es Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters allied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term of office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations over the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in stark contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false pron@@ ounc@@ ements and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax review by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the Democrats in the Pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Consul@@ tant , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish anything before tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already heard that his refusal issues with respect to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business units and various other compounds , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already fallen on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politicians have reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist from the New York Times cited a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters , Tru@@ mp to exchange their tax returns . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the voters and not from tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return dates back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average annual tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clinton &apos;s in 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income taxes of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ work bodies promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
environ@@ ment@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea to do so many years ago , has intensified its funding together with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
previously many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Dog &apos;s Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps comprise the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;

Jewish director dis@@ cards Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots gri@@ pped a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli choice as there were Arab guests according to a staff .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the list of country codes of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
&quot; Lanz@@ mann wrote , &quot;
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; sent him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man named this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
there is no need for this explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
some of them submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged promp@@ ts of Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ ze &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; Israel was not admitted to the rapid election list , &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police susp@@ end tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police deployed rubber floors and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the participants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti spra@@ ying against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , distributed the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies have established connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade break was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is anticip@@ ating a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representative issued around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for witnesses : beverage market attacked in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y event has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a gun , three dark dressed persons who had embra@@ ced their faces were challenged by the employee of the beverage trade , and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been exploited , the police does not share with them . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , i.e. relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators have to run towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and flee from the gravel parking space located opposite the park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have sight@@ ings at the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 pm ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : playing and having fun in summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors on their summer @-@ free time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
during the first school holiday week the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first week of scho@@ oling .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the stro@@ si@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group was delighted at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; culinary delights were offered to children and car@@ ers with their own prepared cour@@ sers such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ h@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops it was cur@@ ated to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and you@@ ths returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage route of all the ministers in presumably two years , the Mini@@ stries of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s goal was offered for the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at the Freiburg Mu@@ en@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern , went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Fr . Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage church and divided the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m away from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is of field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made a break to sing together a song made of specially compiled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the parish halls of the local parish were available . &quot;
&quot; on the stage targets , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and powerful dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the day after that , one stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but had to climb some 500 metres altitude at a low heat and then climbed again afterwards . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the deserved reward was a common barbecue on the beach . &quot;
&quot; after the morning impulse of the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went down to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Mu@@ en@@ ster in the late afternoon and crossed the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot;
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is welcomed the Min@@ is by co operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home as Br@@ ite Gold R@@ ings for Rad@@ sports
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the Men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the legend hau@@ led the legend when he stor@@ med home to conc@@ eal a victory from the favourites of New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y clin@@ ched the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
&quot; they repeated the trick , having only a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ world Championships in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a result .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton were trying to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner set up an olymp@@ ic record in qualifying laps , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders conquered in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der came back shortly after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and most of all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they stepped onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys site , Hin@@ der stated that after a weak start he fell deliberately to the rail@@ road . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the bike rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two further gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; yesterday , he had fought with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 &quot;
the GB team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to collect a string of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; there was drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex and mo@@ b@@ bing alleg@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , who reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to ann@@ ul@@ ment of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of aluminium mol@@ ten from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus raise all supply agreements as the supplying energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria early this year , no other subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa installation in Port@@ land stand at the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting mill consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry melting plant , which led to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; the company shared . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which will have come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L reported that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual depreci@@ ation of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn against the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the start of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of power per year to consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner clan , Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of Cover@@ s was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , locked reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( with exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z on@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classical twist : they all have planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ hair@@ y act of almost every birthday sep@@ sis of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rid brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this public@@ ity . &quot;
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue a new era of carto@@ graphy began .
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her what the Vo@@ gue covers are concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a volume similar to an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the edition attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista have been on the 8@@ 32 pages of the zer 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like &quot; as &quot; Models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Ms J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything fits on J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everyone .
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot; &quot;
these feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ fortune , it seems to pass by the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is to be seen in the Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centres reject 160@@ ,000 people a year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ aries are rejected annually by the commun@@ ing centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and the like - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
the director of the church centres of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ aling the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who rely on violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debt , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just released - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we urge the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers &quot; communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp Camp@@ a@@ ign prosec@@ uted after employee allegedly drew weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign has been accused of alleged inno@@ c@@ ence , after being told that their campaign leader for North Carolina in February had directed a fire@@ arm to an employee while travelling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have waited for months , that the matter would be regulated internally before he realised that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ec@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i handed in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after compl@@ aining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina , the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People were to take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton had to be elected and judge should appoint . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Press spokes@@ man Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls to his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties . &quot;
this gave representative opinion poll@@ s of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could scar@@ c@@ ely rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent , five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only scar@@ ed of the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is disputed among the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD opinion poll@@ s only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; this makes it still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator joined the market .
the success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and larger , so it was not good in the hand either . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather pal@@ p@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West Bas@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive messages for those standards at that time : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator could be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ Browser , though agon@@ ising slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
&quot; smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to and handled by Microsoft . &quot;
today providers dominate the market that came much later than Nokia .
&quot; being online anytime and anywhere , this is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple account for just 5@@ 55 million copies . &quot;
the worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet @-@ communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success started , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the chance to see . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ wing now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to take the Smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of staff in the Siemens Management Board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a big effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ end on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion and a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented bridges of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is backed by £ 16 billion to private investments . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it communicated that users could update their filters in the program to further block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the coding on its advertisements to make it difficult to detect advertisements on which part of the advertising page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the anti @-@ flo@@ cking Open Source Community and the b@@ ail@@ ers has been in progress since the invention of the indicator lights , &quot; and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator block@@ ers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users active on Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebook users . &quot;
&quot; the company has opted for ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs has a sufficiently large share of revenues so that Facebook will see the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be updating its &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook announced that Ad@@ bloc would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the site , which are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we instead focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman in presum@@ ed suicide over Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls on witnesses after a woman was driving on a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was beaten by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident promp@@ ts them to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases , where a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was said in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer of the negli@@ gent killing was acqu@@ itted after having crossed and killed a man who lay in August 2014 on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , who had responded to an emergency call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had previously er@@ d@@ similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protect it from evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow turn of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planet explor@@ ers .
&quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to excessive heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billion years . &quot;
her oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Cli@@ m@@ amo@@ del in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy retired on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot;
&quot; over the summer , I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , that it needs and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination regarding decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had fired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in any of the last years the post@@ season . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike a strike &quot;
&quot; the labour disputes relating to wages for North @-@ sea @-@ oil workers are suspended , while all parties sit for a new round of talks to the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea that were operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; the Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of settlement of the current dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start next year to address the problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice is followed by a 10 % drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company will give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ swing .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified by the British decision to leave the European Union in June . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades con@@ stellation .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates , as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods with the planet development are . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other Stern@@ enh@@ aufen , we experience more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years distant from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood . &quot;
they are now the quick@@ est .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars b@@ ump large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the most recent catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , taking bigger stars slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; as the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars are slow down their rotation rates , and so to speak their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star starts off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base zu Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to both , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , he signed his signature under a ten @-@ year contract to 27 million US dollars annually . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 year old cannot be admitted to the hall of fame of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have taken banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect for years to have been receiving performance @-@ enhancing funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the league could even take me a favour for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
even his farewell days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : little X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are covered by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an inqu@@ isi@@ tive ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese call@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle @-@ runners in Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critical athle@@ tics competitions these news arrive at the in@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last Sunday , Ch@@ en had demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de which is used as a mas@@ ked agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the talks over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will work with the International S@@ CA@@ S and accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news of the positive rehear@@ sal appeared at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; declared the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the forbidden substance should act for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for instance , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abo@@ lic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , and Kenya &apos;s L@@ äu@@ er@@ nation produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in swimming sports , the earlier violations in China had also ensured violent confron@@ tations between the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t har@@ sh@@ ly grab@@ bed the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
it was also the focal point of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; on the Chinese champion@@ ships , Sun was positively tested for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in 2014 , but only had to wait for a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ acker her ran@@ som
programmer of black@@ mail malware currently systematically attacks companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly pay@@ ed the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators explicitly speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential for rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is much higher than private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the paint programs were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the last months frigh@@ tening rapidly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als in a lasting way .
the software then presents the requirements of the black@@ mail .
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware is struck . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened acute by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only support the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in view of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the commercial areas and contact with black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate a bit hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; it is more likely , however , that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building block to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the present malware kits were created by buying malware even , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ off , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log@@ on in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and instruc@@ t another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per licensed computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then deleg@@ ate sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on preventing Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful black@@ out , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is still much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could hen@@ ce@@ forth take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Hack@@ er@@ konferenz &quot; &quot; Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and look pleasant , only the cockpit top falls down there . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage .
&quot; it is not only a boot space of 4@@ 53 l with raised back rests and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a cinema seat and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the ground up to ceilings . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges .
&quot; he should , however , do something qui@@ eter for his work . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is yet another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; top variant , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems include the City Emer@@ gency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane maintenance assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because at manoeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles are rated as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent temperature regulator re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol will get from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with its HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only with haz@@ ards typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; the accident , however , could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline didn &apos;t have to pay damages to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests demonstrated the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , a family was severely ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water . &quot;
the family was in the opinion that the journey had been flaw@@ ed and compl@@ ained against the organizer .
&quot; before the Court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
&quot; however , the organizer was only informed shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs . &quot;
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duties of duty , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be consider@@ ate and determined at the same time to react to terrorist haz@@ ards .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; if the offen@@ ders had to leave the country more quickly , however , they raise the security and strength as well as the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced further personnel enh@@ ancements to the security forces , &quot; in medium @-@ four size order over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be re@@ proved again .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire can be revised so that especially the purchase of weapons on the internet is difficult . &quot;
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y obligation for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as to how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to use concealed investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposed ac@@ tion@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the papers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the dual nationality previously rejected .
it considers a general prohibition of full attri@@ tion to be un@@ constitutional .
&quot; you cannot for@@ bid everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
it is possible to talk about rules for road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green leader Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating action and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it is st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the law of law should be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all the car , who stand in traffic on the ambient street every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ er Straße . &quot;
drivers can then directly navigate directly from the Hammer street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic spl@@ its early , thus improving the overall running sequence on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West . &quot;
&quot; the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is annoying , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; on week@@ days , the back traffic goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ sag@@ a path and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , the traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rebuilt in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to take in particular the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected factory @-@ to @-@ day traffic are going to last , cannot be said to the competent authorities . &quot;
&quot; however , counting years can be expected : because the bridge has an official remaining service life by 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chosen the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities can be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Di@@ alogue : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; . &quot; &quot;
N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a refugee and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; of the Junge The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos; s association , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Junge The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Junge Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language placement are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Tourism &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association pays off with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of the weather
the weather has made the shooting star gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain , to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one pul@@ ls around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is far from the che@@ ek @-@ ring no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aring , member of the board of the German society for slaughter and sleeping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what can be seen below , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an on@@ e- and through @-@ sleep @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely the sleeping experience that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Member of the Board of the German Medical Association , with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind this can contain organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
&quot; in@@ frequently , sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is especially common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; says Weber . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are dependent on each other .
&quot; for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , you can wake up badly , wake up every two or three hours , and possibly start sal@@ ting about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you go to a doctor with in@@ som@@ nia ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , exhausted , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or drugs - classic sleep tablets occur only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , hardly exists in Germany . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleeping problems . &quot;
it can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab and what happens ?
&quot; for example , for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise physicians , for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , in case of sleep@@ iness , sleep @-@ conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make no@@ on@@ n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the folding , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body you wear a nose , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ end on the ceiling . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can apply for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch television for sleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time exhibited his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself from his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 150@@ ,000 € no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 year old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look exactly at dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; he explained further . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A may not participate , &quot; said the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice @-@ cream . &quot;
airport : gang of baggage tigh@@ tened
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police arrested two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage @-@ ste@@ els as gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials recognised a gang in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport , which was well @-@ known to the polic@@ emen from past theft lovers . &quot;
&quot; since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed multiple off@@ ences and have been working together in a collaborative and professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the criminal comm@@ iss@@ ariat 34 can prove four actions to the thi@@ eves , who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in total , they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem so at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a refres@@ hed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel had pronounced himself for a hard action by the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after having been evacu@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ets s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers on June 22 , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers hired the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain in late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is raising three children here , are primarily gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z seeking majority police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner @-@ sen@@ ator and the police force between house @-@ occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which today , in comparison with the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the Riga Zoo . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the R@@ ī@@ ga and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly popular for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world over the past few years : residents of GDR times and former home owners share their neighbourhood with them . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at en@@ capsul@@ ated discs or freshly painted facades that were thrown with inking bags .
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes constitute property damage , which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , uncertainty cannot be a question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is wei@@ rd : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined to do so . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer in the R@@ ī@@ ga any longer .
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately pulled into the Riga Street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important for them that residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings that crowd the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , they are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well cared for , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who anno@@ y themselves about colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , can complain about noise there . &quot;
all people who have only first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee Commissioner for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the icy Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ dest@@ y but rather focused on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place . &quot;
&quot; an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in social work , has been sought after . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organizing , working with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports both honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon new containers are standing in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting fle@@ ets that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must put the refugees in their own or hired lodging facilities .
&quot; the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations have to be borne by the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the office of the office to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; in fact , the administration does not find any private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it didn &apos;t work so far either to rely on private dwell@@ ings , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , communal apartments must be intim@@ id@@ ated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , activity not only means work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so here also the administration and the honorary officials jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it takes just a while , and they can survive the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems , too , &quot; says customers hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : are they afraid of radic@@ alisation after the latest incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; What some nai@@ ve might call &quot; . &quot; a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks would bring them out completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , local and local officials have to look for activities locally and in the region . &quot;
they have always in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy , even so far , to integrate the existing human resources sensi@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; these are currently about 100 persons , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ar sought by helicopter
the police helicopter flew several areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8 : 50 am .
the residents surprised the two and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward in the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies were worn . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
&quot; as a result , the police had deployed several squ@@ ab@@ bles as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the fur@@ ry went without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown were , indeed , near the apartment or when they fled . &quot;
