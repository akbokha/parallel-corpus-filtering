<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted at home in a fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the horse-career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let his family run over the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthaid handed the man from Anhausen to the Golden Sports Pyramid in a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no shortage of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Lorrel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had blamed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prizewinner of the sport pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the double US master winner was added to the Hall of Fame of the German Sports on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the runners belong to the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the caterpillar Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Reuderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the show rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum der Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious society immigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza prize went."</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - we want Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. Presidents are unaware of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep people small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wanted to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserting Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive back regulations massively, and he is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would increase," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"needless to say, Trump and Clinton seem almost worrying."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the democratic candidate, however, announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party-internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and re-operate coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand renewable energies with its investment program:" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazionic trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, demanding around Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rinsist, then he says, he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, stands for boosting growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Fleeing: "every escaped woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the area manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized homes for single-minded women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerating to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the escape are outweighed:" many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they arrived in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and abused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the children are certainly not voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, more accommodation just needs for them, asks Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich, some say no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in accommodation of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabians, escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in some Community homes, there are floors or own houses for single women and their children in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Lower Franconia."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says," It is very important that men and women are hosted separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together, there may be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the crush, which is on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since getting around, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant professors have called their union to approve new work campaigns in their disputes over a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for his whole Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that it would have been appointed ministers to address the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the leader of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would be" persistently quiet "to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC committee agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and challenge official new negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"responding to the silence of the government, the JDC board today submitted a formal proposal to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating work campaigns that begins in early September."</seg>

<seg id="11">The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed to be daunting and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report a whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if there would never be anything worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told him and accusing Ankara to fall back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the offence was even greater, as it was done by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the vetrain becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a heavy, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month at a failed state coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemotsti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued resentment on the slug pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to take advantage of the cool sentiment and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is clearly a matter of course for Moscow which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" Alliance of outsiders "once described: two countries that have been violated and badly treated by the West, and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference saying that they hadn't even stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least once more."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later was the director and chief of Staff of the Regiment Staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidants of Vladimir Putin and worked as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff would return to his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man, who once was promoted as a potential president, wants to lead the Russian environmental policy once again - met with great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said" It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - post office posts for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian president's administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">"once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, approaching ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of Queenson crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "deck blower", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building Queenson crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnessing an engineering skill from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a total of almost 79% of the total bridge deck at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first seal represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north side, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the land side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massively because the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"delicate, as the tolerances upon which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they only amounted to a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds houses from Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: investors should be taken much more seriously in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "Action Plan for Living" at the next council session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann comments:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favourable apartments can also arise in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is," "Bratmann said:" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal housing development programme, which will cost millions and is still to be financed, should ensure incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, such as Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to make even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"no matter how viola, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely up to date: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you look at the loss of some 1,300 cheap apartments whose promotion will expire in the coming years? "</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this happening, the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought out bonds from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to return the apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West City.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one blow, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the West City, Fristen is running at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is increased drastically, one is removed from the goal of the so-called thoroughfare."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social feeble in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Holger Herlitschke said:" "for a large majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"on the other hand, I have concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes."</seg>
<seg id="35">"but what does not mean, however, that a compromise can not yet be found."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children can no longer go outside for playing, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time at staring on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture lost interest before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was displaced by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and once they were found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the cell phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person withdraws every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, shared the Washington Post recently with that within two days of market launch, the number of followed people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data for the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "take 30 minutes" "to" "get away from the sofa" "and" "active every day" "have struggled on deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sports reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also gloomy game perishers who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk around a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even when Smartphone Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be delayed with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, more active and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on the whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also the Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast succumbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall score of 62.198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team kameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles will compete on the Swedish beam during the multi-stage competition of women in the gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight title and, in total, the fifth, while holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was at an end in that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"the last three years have dominated their sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is" the best gymnast ever I've ever seen. ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected her last test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as disappointment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-fight inale of women during the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of Martha Karolyi."</seg>
<seg id="21">"although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long path, this is not really true."</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their land exercises - which includes their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">"this girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a training flight into the gym, trained in the Boorman, became a force."</seg>
<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition competition, a series of victories that will last for as long as Billy wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even if Mustafina led through two turns, the picture deceives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"hourly beam and ground floor - in which, Biles holds the world title - lauded."</seg>
<seg id="28">"again, with 15,433 on the steambar again - and with a 15,933 on the ground still one on it."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears poured out at Biles brilliantly red, white and blue Eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her book book became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old team captain, called" "Grandma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her bottom-up exercise she threw down the audience to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine at the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been at any summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly, this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicon is round off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female attendance at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnastics was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected unexpected, but masterly gynectic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sports classes throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same path as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnastics in the team. furthermore, the last year with Marta Karolyi is a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily arise in private gymnastics that are upheld by parents responsible for training, training, travel, clothing, competition, and hotel costs (for trainers and their trainers and their families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the municipalities a myriad of young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible turnout training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gyms of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "through the wood of the Olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud in Muslim areas flourish</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutry Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption removed from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report is revealed today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles deals verbally with the police, election observers and townhouses to have ignored evidence of electoral abuses due to" "crimes of ethnicity and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister for integration and municipal government, who is now an antagonist, said that intimidation by voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabins in order to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a reference with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must simply call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable inks to a person's finger when they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistle-blowers should receive more protection says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Election Scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutzu Rahman was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had" "perverted" "the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in cynical way" "and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations."</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis of the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation, in which one person chooses to be someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed an alarming effect on the fraudulent postal voting - when older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system including guiding the ID to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"the report states that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or bangladic backgrounds."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" opinions about ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists to process letter codes to stop" "harvests". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list to be used for immigration and social betting purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters prior to choosing according to your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Non removable ink can be used on a person's finger as soon as she has handed down her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to perform to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter of letters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban on political activists to process full postings and envelopes of postelections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up barriers to election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"a change of law, which was facilitated by an accusation of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (National Representation Act 1983)."</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters go on their own in the voting cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "checkup checks" of the election registration departments of the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The Judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud inheritance as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Union in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the shot, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with his knee in the bar and turn, while the attacker crows before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the barrel and move backwards while directing the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it, so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker on your chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shuts his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and stranglomeration of a serious test - by leaking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk threw his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button on a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the check of each object he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting into.</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to check the rinsing button of a traction toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical experts on the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he leaned, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public rail to train stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task put its immune system definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he did justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample line showed a luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometry number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to deny after its luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "That comes close to the worst thing I've got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't check here because it's here disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstorming that ended up saying that we said "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian about, to bullet them and others in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social apartment after a detonation with a damage of £50,000 because she terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Salthi, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were perforated holes, wooden planks were torn, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was a nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who were in the apartment temporarily and the police said that the terror that the family had joined, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive crying, strikers and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"old trash was found in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wood planks were torn open."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called to the police on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing vacated her and her partner this week by forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogivings were cheered by facilitated neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said:" "they didn't care about anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have been given the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the town house rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenants agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogistration is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who courageously listened to us and gave us the information they gave us."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloving on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to cut waste mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine of money after being guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the building's walls were graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will act tenants who do not abide by the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told us that the delogistration should be a clear warning to the other tenants who do not abide by the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as to those who were harmed by such a behavior," "she said."</seg>

<seg id="4">"after a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee informed immediately to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary told us that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, have handed down a primal specimen under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic Village."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert their own research into an IAAF spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IAAF will conduct an evaluation," he said in an IAAF statement. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control station and turned out to be Ferguson Rotich, handed down the rehearsal and signed," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi. "</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete standing on the list for training controls of the world anti-doping agency.</seg>

<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix and the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">"in this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"who does not suit and Erdogan runs, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-closest foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in short, the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticipates tens of thousands of asylum seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even be" some hundred thousand, "the president of the association Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," "says the president of the" "world" "from Friday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already over months passed over Kurdistan strongholds with sanctions, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the beaten putsch, there were still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes refugees themselves, produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Chief of Representatives complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alawite cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, Erdogan wants to raise the pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or distributed over the past hundred years," Toprak said, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chief of Staff called for the Federal Government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the country election will not be held again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for stupid than hitherto it is not: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the champions, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the most holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen, or Hiddensee, are not natives, so may not choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems arise: during the holidays, helpers who hang out posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end votes out, only arduous."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to let the people go over for election campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how much newbie AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition-dusting.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, sailors have cold feet and Chancellor Merkel will blame for the flowering of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create this, "has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if you make election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Angela Merkel chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's parliamentary group is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU does not waive the usual election campaigns on market places and in front shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this means that cocooperates, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union, too, has noted that on the land you will crumble the foundation so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vast expanses of the country there are hardly any."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU electoral fighter Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were last at 22 per cent behind partners CDU (25) and just just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the election of 2011, the SPD had yet clearly won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the land day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of holiday need and transfer their electoral campaign largely to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign", "she calls the president Claudia Müller."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners embark on the search for local vocal chests among holidaymakers."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the speed with which the B 27 is sanitized, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30 am and only end at 20 o'clock in the morning, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty much," "says Elvira Tetzlaff about the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be postponed to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the award will also be the receipt of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of behavioural journeys."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been migrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive on both sides from the B 27 from Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The passage of credentials through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the technical management of the rehabilitation. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneaks were seeking and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franchised.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the municipality insisted on strengthening the mass-vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been bitten.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was with 77 hourly kilometres in the speed-30 zone on the way.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become more calmer."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for business people at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue outbreaks, everyone whom you ask is easy to see through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some more and some are less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for those who have less to do with the" "end customer", "so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "most slight decline", "but also admits that" "course of course" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local pubs along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants was" hard hit. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the sales revenue rose to" "far more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The road marking stopped its operation "two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his co-workers have to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired, the policy would have reacted otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, the inn would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, they also have to bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars are now seeing less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance - he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it is also very nice somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">"that his stem-clientele comes back to the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner holds the effects of B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history."</seg>

<seg id="22">"in the event of deferred asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sanctioned.</seg>

<seg id="25">"and at some point - in the unequal treatment of patient - for example, the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in view of the high refugee numbers, many people were worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply employed could not be clung out in election times.</seg>

<seg id="37">"only a garsty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the department leaders also demand a burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you go to the comment section, to sow it under the pseudonym Non-Alleename men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the redevelopment of vinyl records is not based on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight according to age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It's not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and gamble wildly before I stop, keep my hands and say something wrong as:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I received from Sister Ray (Number of data: eight young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle-aged, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when they appeared and once again buying items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vices.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are inspired to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people usually have to get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took off the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that call happy jugenderings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to deal with spiritual things.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff whispers out of a stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably be very concerned, while I was browsing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilers."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put it on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musical."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people saying," "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly coming in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts his latest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz rols out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but the psychological trauma is hard to imagine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a window-shopping tour than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to give up the jeans underpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who think for a moment around Polaroid Cameras, before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is the one who is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research has yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in record shops in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumblebees on Berwick Street and the leaves by panels, while they steer clear of the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting men of middle-aged."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"at a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to offer 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, sell hair services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">Calais prefecture has argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would be a risk of fire and sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated as useless and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday, estimated that the number of living in the jungle camp was increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcomers in the course of summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening, at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Fiji began to be wonderful, and left the GBs" attacks out of fun. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 up, when Osea Kolinisau echoed in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a pre-eminent Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, Veremalua won a Touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the repuff and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vbreatho Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the GB team and rushed down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play 7, while GB is still learning."</seg>
<seg id="22">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB led fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through to a brilliant interim play of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sulphists, whose fans sang, waving flags and danced on the grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>

<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>

<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, panning and glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very soon.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared of additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the renewable energy sector are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the German Steel Industry Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition) remains at the release of the Renewable Energy Revolution in the German Steel Industry."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations, we could finally reach it."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to checkout."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works fall an EEG levelling of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">So the status quo of the previous ruling is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Stahl is Future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"on the Reform of the Emissions Trading Act, climate and employment objectives are also to be weighed down," "explained IG Metall-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation worsened more than the world's largest producer in China cast massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers reject price dumping Chinese steel corporations.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has become somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, importing import duties on import steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price is picked.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the end, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, mind, health: singing things seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she taught music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors-choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures often dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "speaking and organizing, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs get out of the puste in everyday life as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens Organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia are sinking to long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head is also required for special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially elderly people who live alone, do not only concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition, which one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem increases by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: when I practise for a long time, I will better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can stop there when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many sensing choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">"to her surprise, the mistrust did not let the males get cold - however, they always behaved equally in contrast to the females."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the level of arousal of cat babys at the sight of the little ones.</seg>

<seg id="7">"apparently, the acoustic differences between the mistrust of less and heavily excited kittens for the males either are not perceptible or not of importance," "said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH."</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of kittens cries were different with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adults and eight female cats were observed from the livestock husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a call of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in spite of the low sample, the researchers consider their findings to be meaningful."</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who did not yet have their own offspring, reacted to the cries," "Konerding said."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they turned around faster to the loudspeaker, when this calls played off the very excited kittens."</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be innate or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males ever reacted," "said the biologist."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noises many times in humans."</seg>

<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning two explosives came up again, according to the authorities another person was killed."</seg>

<seg id="11">"when detonating near the popular seaside town Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police charges."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban clerk."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Revier of the Coastal Police."</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally they called for detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon at the south-east coast several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably the action of the Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not stand in connection with the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman said in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in the past few days, the authorities would have kept secret indications of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks stole.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police instructed their officials across the country to reinforce the security of important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but most of the time they are not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"after the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry strongly recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihito and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, all necessary journeys are discouraged in these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution laid out by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This admits a major influence to the military in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"junta chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody turmoil, resisted itself to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the conflict, more than 6500 people were killed."</seg>

<seg id="18">"Maate said, for this he had no knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point."</seg>

<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral agent."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended his first race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting character that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special starting right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more famous.</seg>

<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel of Whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" prosperity bump, "the English boulevard" The Sun "was funny about him with" Dad Bod. ""</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azlocality, the wastewater fee will increase once again at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are required."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azzurro is then 4.37 euros per cubic metre."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the household by the office of the office Kulmbach, it was established that undercoverings have been installed for these sewage plants."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, the citizens and industrial and industrial enterprises from Welsh, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zulte berg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous period of calculation must also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the serious fee increases so that there were relatively small facilities at all three sewage plants with a very low waste water attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the past calculation period of all three plants, refurbishment and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent on all three facilities."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azlocality is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for puppets, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Aztecs sewage plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the pumping plant Weltenderahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and the first sewage sludge had to be extended after almost 20 years, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional aeration facility was installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "these extraordinary expenses came from the continued support and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which are still far below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "full."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs at the waste water facilities in the past 20 years, had been spared."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious in the view of stone houses, especially as the supply area of the Friesebachtal sewerage association could not be extended by these facilities because it concerns public deficits."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are non-bloated, self-locking tools that generate over 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have critiqued critics in which they were accused that the app Blackface would promote or propagate white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when it proposed to some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage continued on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was meant to be a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature from Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders, who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"grace sparapani wrote in an e-mail, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widespread over the photos that the filter was" hurtful and the least unpleasant. ""</seg>

<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.</seg>

<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diversed in the race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting to a user," "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was before," "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Snapchat account and others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that raf-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the setting practices in Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership distorted ISIS intelligence, establishes Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to record a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were permitted on the ground, a committee of enquiry held in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Defense Forces Committee, intelligence committees and the military budget, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering, typically deterred by high-ranking Centcom commandees, regularly marked a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it would have permitted the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom extend to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailled problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government officials have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superior laws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, Statements and Statements prior to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after it was played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights, while the investigations will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom Reports are being conducted by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created a moderately limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking Demokrat in the Commission, Member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, as Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "shamed the morals under analysts and" gave little room for dissenting opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon general inspector, who received complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the demining information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush intended only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year the team headed for Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, finds that contrary to the statements by the government airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing in front of the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but that knows, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain undefeated."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (her two older sisters play sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the caster.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "said Bam."</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the helm all around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door row in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2-0 guidance."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the door keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a barrel.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and inescapable, a fast-paced relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the turner to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been well known under these known names, which are sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-sensitive TV advertising, if he is a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for Gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the flipper and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I want to make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparse that many of them, I asked, did not know that it is an Olympic sport altogether."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampolines and has had an athlete, who has made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds appropriate for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clownschool than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never ending upward pressure - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two types of sport that it essentially combines."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much like" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are rated according to the official" "Olympiaprogram" "by design, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they chase not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympia-ord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as tiresome when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an attire of it.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumping is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant repeal of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. turner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects its blowing, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protestors were killed during the clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police fired and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable rate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to lead the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and don't have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Abysssies. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a far-criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which have been more or less enforced in recent years and could arm and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of infestation under the surface now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government obstructs access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies hiding where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians made their way to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who are predominantly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are co-ordinated under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," "said Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of protests protested against elections which, according to the analysts, were apparently fucked by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest was over relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an ampersist city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has been founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by angling that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave rise to new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings out his comrades who endeavour to take protection during an eventful period, into the peculiar position, to explain statements he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement during an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump stayed back on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism is booming down on Mr. Trump, while trying to focus his campaign on falling demand values on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic frontiers in politics and then to call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction expires." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observed the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more estimated sound, as its survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a large lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or mislead his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while strengthening the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocative his statements might be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he is saying are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them rear-bankers, completely wrong, and so it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread aggressively by taking control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being round about each of his words and being accused of him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You cannot! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's excuse as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="6">"the artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter," I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel apart and Verb is now a soap shop. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"but if New York is changing, it's also new finding."</seg>
<seg id="8">"a revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a client offered him to provide cash for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez stated that he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garrulings such as capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural tears of nature.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez stated that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by the Williamsburg pricing," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira has been such a customer."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the verb regularly."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way."</seg>
<seg id="27">"after the verb had closed, she gave up coffee for a while, she said."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb I liked," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition."</seg>
<seg id="30">"since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal is another long-standing and loyal customer."</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came fourth after seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they are preparing my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">"nowadays Rosenthal is still receiving his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese."</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez stated that he had no grudge that the soap shop took the old business area.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for verb to make with the coffee-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will continue to deal with it," "said Rodriguez."</seg>
<seg id="38">"and the traditional Polish inhabitants, Greenpoints, also accepted the café."</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez stated that he pretends to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee into bottles.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Brickman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">COEs Last Book "Chop Suey" acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while bricks in her book "97 Orchard" were told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the latest collaboration," A decent meal, "published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, local snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixes ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hacky, the couple found it fitting for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanuts, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "shows the ways in which the country was going to no longer be the land of Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgetary was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and assertions became a staple food, the casserole as a" wonderful way of reinforcing food leftovers, "when cooks were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"different mixtures were tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy food-sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickman continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"like never before or since, household economists, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have dealt with the country's eating habits."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the basis of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a recipe for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed long ago that Greenland will become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow-motion-turpentine measured it, when they cut six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the icesea and look for cadavers that torso out of higher water-layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the core core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth was to lie after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons attempt larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"with a length of 220 centimeters in length, the lentist, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, which is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all major Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 volumes in its lentil nucleus, which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long Greenland-shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters could even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandshark females only get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers of the length could assign an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the reproduction are obviously at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusals live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources more in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"therefore, the city on the Main has the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very probable that Frankfurt profits most from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the IW. "</seg>

<seg id="10">"while in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage route of all the ministers in presumably two years, the Ministries of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's goal was offered for the Holy Year of Mercy at the Freiburg Muenster."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern, went on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Fr. Storost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage church and divided the pilgrim's blessing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster of Our Lady stands and so the Pilgrim away from Münster was started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writing texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the minis of field crossings, chapels or churches repeatedly made a break to sing together a song made of specially compiled pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the nights, the parish halls of the local parish were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the stage targets, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty and powerful dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the day after that, one stepped up the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but had to climb some 500 metres altitude at a low heat and then climbed again afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the evening, the deserved reward was a common barbecue on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse of the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went down to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Muenster in the late afternoon and crossed the gates of mercy."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the Men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the legend hauled the legend when he stormed home to conceal a victory from the favourites of New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy clinched the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, having only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underworld Championships in London, despite the withdrawal of Hoys."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a result.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner set up an olympic record in qualifying laps, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders conquered in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder came back shortly after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and most of all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they stepped onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys site, Hinder stated that after a weak start he fell deliberately to the railroad."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the bike rom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two further gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had fought with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260"</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to collect a string of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, who reached its peak at the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to annulment of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of aluminium molten from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus raise all supply agreements as the supplying energy company announced."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria early this year, no other subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa installation in Portland stand at the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting mill consumes around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry melting plant, which led to closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt," the company shared. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging transactions", "which will have come into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," said the power supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL reported that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual depreciation of $187 million in" "anticipation of a cancellation". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn against the potential closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts at the start of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power per year to consume about 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator it would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of Covers was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), locked reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz onle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classical twist: they all have planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché-hairy act of almost every birthday sepsis of a children's show (Seacrid brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue a new era of cartography began.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her what the Vogue covers are concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a volume similar to an illustrated book as a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista have been on the 832 pages of the zer 615 pages advertisement)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover-stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years, there were clearly more" celebrities who like "as" Models, celebrities are "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls under the former category, is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything fits on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners don't like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always something tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her" the mistress of the moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but on the misfortune, it seems to pass by the point."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters are selling images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is to be seen in the Reality TV. probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">20 years ago Nokia Communicator joined the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors are dominating the world today - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and larger, so it was not good in the hand either."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather palpable."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would now suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as an "office in the West Basket."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive messages for those standards at that time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator could be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible via HTML-Browser, though agonising slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody was able to guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">"smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to and handled by Microsoft."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today providers dominate the market that came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"being online anytime and anywhere, this is today for a lot of people's everyday lives."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"some 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple account for just 555 million copies."</seg>
<seg id="28">The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">England must steer the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a big effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies in the vicinity of Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamend on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion and a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion investment investment program in time and budget, from T5 to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented bridges of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is backed by £16 billion to private investments."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"for companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking, a" cat and mouse game. ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it communicated that users could update their filters in the program to further block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the coding on its advertisements to make it difficult to detect advertisements on which part of the advertising page is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-Her battle between the anti-flocking Open Source Community and the bailers has been in progress since the invention of the indicator lights, "and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicator blockers have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display blockers worldwide, almost four times as much in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion active users active on Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebook users."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the company has opted for ad blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and instagram, shared a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs has a sufficiently large share of revenues so that Facebook will see the investment of such a step as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would be updating its" ad preferences pool "to give people more control over them."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook announced that Adbloc would be worrying new filters because they would also block content on the site, which are not advertising."</seg>
<seg id="14">"for the users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook spokesman in an e-mail message. "</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was beaten by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said these as well as every witness of the incident prompts them to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, divided Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases, where a person ran in the dark on the highway, it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was said in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a police officer of the negligent killing was acquitted after having crossed and killed a man who lay in August 2014 on the A1 near Payerne."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, took the judgment."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had previously erdsimilar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect it from evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow turn of Venus exposed its day-side of the Sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades constellation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates, as well as in what context the rotational periods with the planet development are."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other Sternenhaufen, we experience more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="5">The cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this constellation, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotational rates, these poignant stars bump large amounts of constellations."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars."</seg>
<seg id="10">"when a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The most recent catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rebull compares the stars with dancers, taking bigger stars slower than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hacker her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmail malware currently systematically attacks companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, several times victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly payed the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators explicitly specialize their blackmail software on attacks in company networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential for redeeming ransom is much higher than private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the paint programs were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the last months frightening rapidly."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals in a lasting way.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the requirements of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware is struck."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened acute by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: pay not, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the commercial areas and contact with blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate a bit hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is more likely, however, that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building block to the actual blackmail.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls down there."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is not only a boot space of 453 l with raised back rests and 1026 l, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a cinema seat and thus offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the ground up to ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges.</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temperature regulator reacts to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>

<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening, one pulls around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the cheek-ring no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, says Hans-Günter Wearing, member of the board of the German society for slaughter and sleeping medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what can be seen below, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an one- and through-sleep-disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is precisely the sleeping experience that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Medical Association, with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind this can contain organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">"infrequently, sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially common in case of depression," "says Weber."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are dependent on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, if you have a herniated disc, you can wake up badly, wake up every two or three hours, and possibly start salting about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you go to a doctor with insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day, should go to the doctor, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, exhausted, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or drugs - classic sleep tablets occur only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, hardly exists in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleeping problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise physicians, for example in snoring with respiratory failure, in case of sleepiness, sleep-converters or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disturbance, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make noonnap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the folding, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body you wear a nose, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the sleeping-end on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts on: regular sleeping and standing times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch television for sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then one starts to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="3">"on the facade of a gray house someone has" "ugly!" "sprayed."</seg>
<seg id="4">"opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new tenants."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks article about this" trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel had pronounced himself for a hard action by the police against the project, the area as a" no-go zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after having been evacuated on the ground floor, the Kadets smiths, with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled out official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wagons on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers hired the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain in late late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are primarily generalized by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez seeking majority police protection against vandaliating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin inner-senator and the police force between house-occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers" quarter, which today, in comparison with the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Riga Zoo."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rīga and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly popular for tourists and electors from all over the world over the past few years: residents of GDR times and former home owners share their neighbourhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at encapsulated discs or freshly painted facades that were thrown with inking bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year along with the words" "left-autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes constitute property damage, which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, uncertainty cannot be a question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is weird: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined to do so."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer in the Rīga any longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into the Riga Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important for them that residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former buildings that crowd the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, they are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well cared for," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who annoy themselves about colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the icy Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less modesty but rather focused on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in social work, has been sought after."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organizing, working with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports both honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting fleets that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must put the refugees in their own or hired lodging facilities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations have to be borne by the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the office of the office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in fact, the administration does not find any private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it didn't work so far either to rely on private dwellings, such as Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, communal apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homework, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity not only means work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also the administration and the honorary officials jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain to the refugees that it takes just a while, and they can survive the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems, too," says customers honestly, "people with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after the latest incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no, Regine customer says quite clearly," "What some naive might call". "a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude it."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks would bring them out completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, local and local officials have to look for activities locally and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach is already busy, even so far, to integrate the existing human resources sensibly."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently about 100 persons, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
