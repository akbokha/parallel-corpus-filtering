Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as of Te@@ hr@@ an destabili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed should also go . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu was at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress held a controversial speech which was partly perceived as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had refused him with regard to the election to be forthcoming in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , professor stands up to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officers found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was rit@@ tered on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already had 300 miles to the school premises where he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , where he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both established in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problemati@@ cal behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , which had worked so hard for the Lamb , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ b &apos;s track , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb slain himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he completed his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the gir@@ dle of women . &quot;
&quot; all the girls were mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously spending some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues . &quot;
&quot; Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail comp@@ eted three years ago both on a summer fair . &quot;
later they played together the one or the other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes an entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic@@ ator in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the Dead professor , initiated the first @-@ semester program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was the president of his fr@@ at@@ ernity and the student committee . &quot;
&quot; around 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service . &quot;
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil and sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ lie@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss indeed called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us say that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it would plan to set 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . 4@@ 5.000 employees were employed during the Christmas season in 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that it will begin with job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , Christmas markets are getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox scre@@ ams over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty beside me and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated G@@ äh@@ nen and a length of it away from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ edly the biggest travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected theaters in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban K@@ i @-@ moon , Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon , said his answer to Russia is reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader once again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integrated negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly &apos;s Council meeting to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ban also called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , proving them in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as the flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the property @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s stamina and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of them say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp@@ s temp@@ er as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish voters who are ten@@ ding to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number holds in the first random@@ ly state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their scholars , republi@@ can voters become Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who wins GO@@ P nom@@ ination most likely , four out of ten after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters will see Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating anyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other rep@@ ublic@@ ans , Tru@@ mp has re@@ ap@@ ed the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have made their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp will say they have voted for their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp has been calling immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration has been a pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on matters of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do so . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , anno@@ yed with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea resort .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a home roof yard costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - hence the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German dwelling locations - with square meter prizes in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well @-@ noted . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
dual scor@@ er in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e took a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the gre@@ ek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack@@ ers ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9. ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth consecutive success in series is to be the first step in the direction of the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; Müller received his 28th results in the Champions League on the Bavarian leadership of ben@@ evol@@ ent Mi@@ th@@ ilfe from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart , Roberto , who had a well thought out shot of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 3@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held words . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his recent six home games in the royal class , among them famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
&quot; but Bayern , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dly in their offensive efforts , but often too resour@@ ceful to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks have been initiated too often by shifting to left @-@ handed Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; from the right , Müller was lucky enough to hit his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the potential 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer broke the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by take @-@ out , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians raised their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could pin need@@ les . &quot;
but at Tor@@ s@@ war@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was leaving .
&quot; so , for example , when he directed a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; prior to New he let Guardi@@ ola defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was only given the green light after the final practice , &quot; said Sec@@ ure@@ CFO Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the defeated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 51 . ) . &quot;
&quot; Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter he made a note . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience block had apparently provoked the supporters of Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and approached the Munich @-@ based pendant . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : in doing this , the risk decreases quickly . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the Deutsches Institut für Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
not clari@@ fied whether smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research .
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years before endanger@@ ing the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham explained . &quot;
&quot; one needs to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; said H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our knowledge also leads to good dental health up to the old age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study rein@@ forces the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on remains from the late Anti@@ quity on Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist office for archaeological soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third construction section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists now found it . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman from freight train recorded
&quot; after a young woman arrives at the station in the vul@@ cano @-@ lin@@ ders , the Federal Police asks the people to help . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it has carried serious violations of it according to the Federal Police . &quot;

European Commission proposes new court in dispute on TTIP
the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to resolve the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP .
&quot; accordingly , the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system , which is significantly more traditional in its functioning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; declared Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US free trade talks .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade area in the world will be created with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; in concrete terms , the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ ee that the EU states and the United States have jointly selected independent judges for a new court of investment . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to protest against sentences .
&quot; so far the parties involved have agreed to each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; in the debate in recent months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , be clari@@ fied also disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings demanded above all by large corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration Cour@@ ts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which companies can claim damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ ver@@ aging national legislation or reducing consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
it was mainly critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German State Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission took into consideration key points on the reform , which the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the employment possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Prime Club , Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gr@@ asp@@ ed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells us about different places he always records on the map , what his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs report . &quot;
where they originated and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be wonderfully creative . &quot;
&quot; with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs seem to be harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the opul@@ ent opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the ru@@ mor arises , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a series of we@@ ary series : each of the 50 US states should be said in a row . &quot;
&quot; however already in 2004 and in the Rhine @-@ proximity , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens comes down here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later the musician who lives in New York is returning to the series .
with &quot; Il@@ linois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a nationwide masterpiece is published in 2005 .
sur@@ rendering to ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and lacks any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic off@@ sets . &quot;
&quot; this sixth proper studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although now nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; disk basically &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens modest , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister Fra@@ gran@@ ce since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce and for the first time mo@@ oring with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six pre @-@ set questions shortly after mid@@ day and his performance is probably audi@@ ted by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to their colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several front @-@ pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; within Labour , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour &apos;s changes lay ahead in order to remove the whole idea of a constra@@ int altogether .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions ministers said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory boss over the Dis@@ patch box over the last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another set of policies , says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Fra@@ gran@@ ces of the Prime Minister are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from being &quot; &quot; pun@@ ish@@ able &quot; &quot; and stri@@ kers with hooks , instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the shadow of economic minist@@ erial ministers , if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues would occasionally seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy Theater , &quot; often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the inquiry with the prime minister was seen as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House and its position among his Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , even though critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound jump@@ ed on data , showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and generated estim@@ ation since 2009 on the time of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures propose all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining hypothesis said that he took $ 2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of his strategy of reducing debt . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill states that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on the Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin

&quot; blasph@@ em@@ y 21 years young , a hanging with an over@@ ni@@ b@@ ous rise . &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
&quot; at present , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; : here you live i@@ dol , whose poster are hanging at St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the Suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs just as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves in half a year . &quot;
if at all .
&quot; she says : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the 10th grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who it@@ ches it ?
the fans do not .
even bending is not possible .
this has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertising break of Super@@ nov@@ a , he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ anz@@ ee company , spending many , many dollars on the bending account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ hes . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to No. 1 .
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster introduces Lebanese to potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or woo@@ fers ?
&quot; both - namely in the potato @-@ we@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a plac@@ ard of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he saw random@@ ly on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , a grill sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , is spinning in his store . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; writes Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile submitted to the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay would not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding is also a good thing with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches campaign campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - collapse
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign campaign to defend the market share of retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eis@@ ler S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor @-@ strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia represent nearly 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut some five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers might lose $ 360 million sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year , Al@@ di will open 25 branches in WA and 30 in WA , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million US $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ a &apos;s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly react to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the executive board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the breakdown of operations on sales and margins at the same time . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and deliver I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores with fast growing fresh foods and to deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ ali@@ h &apos;s managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading restoration programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 , for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious fight of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; soon afterwards , in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp@@ f crossed a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am quite busy about is the fact that in my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too rigor@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s trained hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; he@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z on the important pre @-@ decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his action . some time outside the spotlight he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and cleared the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants arrived in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations got on .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some with@@ drew from protest food and water .
&quot; said Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister , &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that by the end of the year or by the end of the year an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency status issued on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to told that his country would also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insist@@ ed on the fact that most of the incoming business refugees are in search of a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher liability for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very plain@@ ly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are in a position to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and push a crowd to go there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
&quot; the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win over to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he is running for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton supporters are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage over older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters throughout the country say they would support Clinton if nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
it may not be surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters think this about their peak channel data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the di@@ sen@@ ti@@ bility are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - though one third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elec@@ tors of the Pre @-@ elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den is their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to qualify for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage is increased from S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic elec@@ tors see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure dropped by 78 percent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ des is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , call democratic voters questions about voting . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these sel@@ ections stands out as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters in the pre @-@ election of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cutting off hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries generally also view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being set up as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public overall .
&quot; half the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , though 36 percent said that her opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views are deterior@@ ating from Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voters throughout the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good grades in leadership . &quot;
&quot; out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new survey is due to the two candidates , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support grows of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son reaches well with demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp from Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor , John Kad@@ esh , is defeated by Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son gets in the poll@@ s - he lands with 19 % support in rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with it . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood affected by the death of a Bar@@ uch College Student
&quot; two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people were submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he was bur@@ dened with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to hospital .
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ osh@@ eph Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt strength injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the sh@@ rou@@ ghs of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died of the ch@@ ic@@ anes each year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members due to murder of the third rank .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with pi@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal gang . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation with the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest
&quot; interest increase comes , and the house se gets fu@@ elled , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession came within 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so severely that investors should not concentrate when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants might find that the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of interest in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends as to how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment may be triggered , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after it ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief plant @-@ strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increase cycle and the return on loans begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity but interest rates often promote it .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in such fragile economic scenery could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants took the whole year to a net interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the increase cycles of 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions are put forward very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the yields seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the app@@ endi@@ ces immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause ren@@ ders to move closer between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; highly @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in general , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their equi@@ val@@ ents with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will most lose , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the mere share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ ca@@ ster because of its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly unable to distinguish commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament colleague , Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins , attacked the show &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be the Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , that I will not learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is also really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to step up commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced in special BBC mode .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house st@@ ables &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment starts . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order of other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result ever since the records began in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down expenses in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that &apos;s going on , and we may see that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will withdraw their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers died around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers sites collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the purch@@ as@@ ers were fighting for bar@@ gain , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca with the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burial moun@@ ds in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia puts down the collapse partly of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
&quot; those who were gri@@ eving , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay their respect , when the first of the dead started their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ench@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the procession asc@@ ended to the holy place , where only days before a tree @-@ crane fell by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed @-@ ends . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king hung over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a sanc@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 Bet@@ ters , who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mo@@ p of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage than the crane was supported . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual meeting in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the rab@@ bit to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane , when it was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the great mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the add@@ res@@ see who will take place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project managed by the bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major building projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a retired son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
&quot; government officials believe that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other injured get half of this amount .

&quot; British employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
&quot; this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , will be opened &quot;
King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets at the same time include sales points nationwide
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their homes , &quot;
&quot; if you can deal with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; British workers increasingly employ arti@@ sans to do home @-@ work jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , has now sur@@ passed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 points of sales of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to have more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions are taken by women .
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , with more female single households having more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to shift this into a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decrease in half @-@ year profit and turnover after the group inde@@ b@@ ted the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to un@@ faith@@ fulness in court
at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and par@@ atro@@ phy .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the pre @-@ study cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 used money from the association &apos;s accounts on which they were allowed to dispose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial years .
&quot; this fact was eliminated by the President of the Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; in order to delay in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association did not constitute an asset in any time . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials would only have paid expense allowance and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were confronted with the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the bre@@ w profession of the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have put money , our life insurance policies were laid down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , with appropriate financial success , the payout of the expense allowance has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; thus also l@@ ump and not detail cancell@@ ations appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts kept the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial sector , but it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigations into account of office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were set@@ backs , declared the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and was not known to the association according to his statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know a response for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the association .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; damage indem@@ n@@ ity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , Ju@@ dge and At@@ tor@@ ney wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association never had any harm . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never procu@@ red a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; on di@@ ets , he charged the club 1,000 euros a month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years were unable to present the accused .
&quot; they were no longer kept after an operational test , in which everything had been correctly judged , they declared . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter money also occupied the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the exercises are in cash , in addition to that he had to drive from his place to the international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard sets another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to personnel mining that has been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions at the US Compu@@ terri@@ esen Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of EUR 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30,000 employees . &quot;
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share amounted to 2.3 percent .
&quot; the company , grown up by printers from California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : so the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive positions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently responded that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more business online .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan fores@@ ees a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly face rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent showed up appro@@ v@@ ingly . &quot;
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
&quot; in contrast , 24 percent agree to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in co @-@ operation with the Syrian authorities , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents refused , 20 percent would be for it . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility will be at the centre of the fair until September 27 . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; the organisers of the V@@ DA car association , like two years ago , reck@@ on with about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; the Hungarian police set up a number of refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and wat@@ chers . &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed violence in the border control centre .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees penet@@ rated the border .
&quot; behind that , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a laun@@ cher was ready . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the function@@ aries were initially punc@@ tu@@ ated with pe@@ pper@@ mint .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time to decide on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether interest rates have been raised for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist for a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and initiate a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the reduced view of global relations . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death ar@@ cher at the Delta State University leave excuse
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , He hath cast upon a man , and a man shall be put to death . &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb left 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen en@@ cir@@ cled him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who stated that she was married for about seven years , was described as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb sum@@ mon@@ ed relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He does not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor has also said to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ning : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
&quot; 150 of the roughly 1,000 leaders around the world will cost the work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the trade union . &quot;
the Lufthansa is building up its business structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap daughter Eu@@ phr@@ ates .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is an earnings contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , in the future Lufthansa is no longer a board member for the passenger business . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ phr@@ asing should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the management board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Mr. Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ ro@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; with the new setting , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ phr@@ ates , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airline operates under the roof of the Air@@ line Group &apos;s Passage Group , which represents three quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective bar@@ gaining conflict with the pilot &apos;s association Cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be res@@ um@@ ed on this Thursday after the Stri@@ ke Stri@@ ke Stop . &quot;
this divided the union with .
the subject of the talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year , the cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible by forec@@ asting a &quot; &quot; record result &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; division . &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors routes to the group own low @-@ cost eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this made the left external defender to cry and exclude him for at least six months of play , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double missi@@ le and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group stage . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not pen@@ alized the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ o , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ o . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know what it feels like , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you almost know it by heart . &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President opted for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , as it seems to be always a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ produces an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to see the girl of his dreams , reading her desire to see a real tree &quot; , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this were not suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the story of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a forward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid develops with the ball , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England Test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the course of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even though he did not get such good performances , and that &apos;s not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test @-@ drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first put Jonathan in the Caribbean at first - but this lost opportunity now lies in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales came in , and he is a drummer , whom I set high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which we met very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and receive four qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred races straight away and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood enters the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful operation to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights we can benefit from . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing room , even if the messages are in tune with the previous one . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not employed at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy gets into a l@@ ous@@ te until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented new negotiating strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get into trouble with every day , even without the choice of ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who was severely dis@@ cour@@ aged for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at , recently said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always out of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive amendments that they do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , looking for an outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as in the exagger@@ ated long har@@ dening like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande is looking for his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a powerful force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better for preventing Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; that is why some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , in the whole of the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ or@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they didn &apos;t support it during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all his back@@ war@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones and pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ ali@@ tions , most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noted that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute banana to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened his back door . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on his back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &quot; s , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild il@@ lic@@ it of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ alter@@ ism can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father , on television , tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the media campaign for a natur@@ al@@ ness , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks this way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussions among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Basic report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal of Lanc@@ et last month res@@ or@@ ted the &quot; extremely wind@@ y foundation , &quot; based on his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Monitoring ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also under@@ signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the financing he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a branch finance in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s research work clearly indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he Report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted earlier . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes health risks are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ poin@@ ter , says former Head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ poin@@ ter and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in a hard controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider for a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least rely on programs that others don &apos;t do or put on commission . &quot;
they send the Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed programs that could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ poin@@ ter is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I &apos;m tired of seeing how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for the quest for ratings , because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart teaching in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one can rather not measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee on the radio fee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , we all think that for £ 150 per year here you get a great value , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 per year , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also warned of the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check , train and maintain its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to inform , enligh@@ ten and maintain this in the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances , to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by qu@@ arri@@ es of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work by switching Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day could replace the low brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread@@ worms do not normally react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cann@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; if he applies ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to worms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impulses of light on and off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily susp@@ end the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important notice : take the DL@@ R at the DL@@ R ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from September 15 to 18 , and you can read the trademark of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into an image of a tank . &quot;
&quot; in September , a flock of arms traders will be riding with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help stop the arms trade show . &quot;
the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in banking D@@ ism@@ aland .
&quot; a collective called Special Pat@@ rol Group helped to distribute in London and used &quot; ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ in@@ bus package , claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops advertising spaces on the planet . &quot; &quot;

&quot; after Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and attempt to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries . &quot;
many artists engage with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they must go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trading posters gre@@ ets the commuters in the subway .
&quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist , who also works for free . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms trade fair - through a leak of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ ang company advertising , but &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residen@@ ces reaches from slightly annoying to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal , where you are standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly , Mar@@ m@@ ite don &apos;t love nor hate because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those with which you would not speak , even if your lashes were bla@@ sted in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night event venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not think about starting a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos ank@@ le : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw a few things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
&quot; as you start the university at the high point of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to conver@@ se and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poorly mixed cl@@ ots of flour , sugar and fat cause people to lie dor@@ man@@ t when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a washing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours whether it &apos;s up to them to make Drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep for two hours before they broke their own music , shut down their door and went to their three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to enter the same residence hall by chance ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ing when you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , to get rid of them , separate yourself and see them every day , and maybe see how they bring together all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a bit of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes a moment until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , you never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t stap@@ le your holding on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Town Houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Single Bo@@ dies , L@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother and the Ger@@ ing servant . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great part .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient housing in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one under@@ takes people in blocks of residence .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
the houses can then easily be converted according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .

how did the residents react to their town@@ house project ?

what is definitely not right .

&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true , however : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury homes which can hardly afford more . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , typing &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then selecting &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message telling that the &quot; software update is failing . &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to wait either to wait for the rush to go back or try upgrading via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to break@@ age of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula One against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; ahead of the start in the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup leader stressed that I had nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and also won the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; Alten@@ markt Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; have merged under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses there . &quot;
the social foundation moves down from the mountain to the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , senior citizens and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as health care insurance or services of the health care insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been setting up with our out@@ patient care service that often caring relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; the new household owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the &quot; &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; Bürger@@ sa@@ ital &quot; &quot; and the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; , &quot; explained not only rarely many services of the insur@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken by boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center is seen by both business leaders , particularly in demographic change . &quot;
this is because it is essential to make a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
&quot; in addition , thus under@@ lined mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the compatibility at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able commitment . &quot;
this makes the Foundation a great contribution that senior citizens can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment .
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to noon . &quot;

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang passed 92 years
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of the Viennese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died already on September 5th at the age of 92 , like the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday communicated . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus awarded an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as stated in the broadcast . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
three persons also stayed on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck it with the fist .
the victim suffered an outbreak of the nose and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim at first . &quot;
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to their apartment , and went there demonstr@@ atively several times . &quot;
&quot; when the car was no longer seen , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a stroke , one applied on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured person had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
&quot; until now , only one vag@@ ue work description is present . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 m tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and witnesses to sign in under the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros &quot;
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ auses .
&quot; also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing happiness : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice there on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ auses is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was symp@@ a@@ thetic to the first view when the Fel@@ ce@@ aus met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently do their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and who also wants to enter into practice this year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ er would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ auses and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called it . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss as soon as possible . &quot;
and so one agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in sh@@ aus@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the double family father Frank Müller has also grown up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as an emergency medical specialist in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the work of DR@@ K @-@ readiness frac@@ tional @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ auses , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ alist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a house @-@ doctor . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 euros will be granted by the Müll@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that practice is continued , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ Rhin@@ may@@ de@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks , in the North German A@@ verage Practice approximately 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if there was no successor , it would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours , also looks above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical experts and the cleaning force from the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ esen , smiling . &quot;
they feel a little mel@@ anch@@ oly after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; her husband , laugh@@ ing , said : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; until now I &apos;ve always pressed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we are leaving the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to it .
&quot; it is clear , however , that anyone who wants to put up an asylum request can also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the care and safety of the people .
&quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - denied Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia , too , wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up corri@@ dors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the interior minister , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already severely controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to seal its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fill out his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees would have tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia , in order to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly a matter of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country , with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that the people were wise to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , at least in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were travelling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had been around 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany , Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually lead to a shift in the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west along the way .
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently present a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local ophthalm@@ ological appearance in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature death . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it would not be a very high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mines . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clean@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

&quot; with the information provided , in@@ sider trading in the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were raised to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C announcement . &quot;
the processes against 32 other defend@@ ants continued in this case .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the United States and Eastern Europe .

&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe pain@@ stak@@ ingly pointed out to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteers .
&quot; while some people spontaneously grab@@ bed the chal@@ k and read the sentence &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; don &apos;t suffer for a long time &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .

&quot; therefore , this public@@ ity @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to share publicly on the tables , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death remains still with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has greatly contributed to the opening of people . &quot;

&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was inv@@ oked by the call of volunteers , she immediately reported and had been there with the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives are accompanied in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
all are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and her experiences and experiences .

the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as further education and supervision of the mort@@ al and funeral services .

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Score Mix@@ ed , Finance outlook for 2016 lowered &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the supply giant decreased its profits over a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;

&quot; despite the price increases , the lower view will be 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ ging transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; solid earnings , &quot; considering the weaker economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million US $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , forec@@ asted twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion US $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tization , which resulted in sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result decreased in freight business because of higher labour costs . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time in nearly a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening over them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision which is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to get we@@ aned from unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the economic data show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest in federal bonds - and be it just about a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation primarily will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do and what is going on in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest increase this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow , promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Index rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if it does , in its declaration , it would have to go very far to calm the financial markets , so that they do not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions , which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage figure dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that the Chinese economy slow@@ ed down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , where the Dow is now around 10 % below the May high . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market tur@@ mo@@ il influences the complex calculation , when to raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what effects will be on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the currency authority of the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; his decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; senior Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who is committed to increase interest in interest rates , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited apparent impact on growth in the US , &quot; he said . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Sav@@ ings of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of interest in interest because the markets are rising , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should be ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / camp is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewel@@ ery and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot;
&quot; when the whole shopping experience makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ express . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s and has different taking options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish the@@ ke - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even cook on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freeze department . here you will find Fro@@ zen Cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ ing , whole du@@ cks , fish , bo@@ vine blu@@ t and g@@ all , pork @-@ natural intest@@ ine , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owner and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide pas@@ sage@@ ways are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : living aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; even with her 74 sequences , she still likes to teach . &quot;
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different from a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good nutrition is during breast feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adap@@ tion to mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
planning for the long @-@ awaited sne@@ aker building at Bern@@ ese sports grounds move step by step : in the recent council session the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
&quot; before that , the Panel had decided , among other things , an application for a construction @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; from the applicable development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , an &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ member@@ ed first and roof top &quot; shall be erected . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; again , it was about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is dict@@ ated by energetic reasons - elsewhere than in the development plan - to be below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan regarding the roof inclin@@ ation did not allow &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - although Bern@@ ese &apos;s municipal council usually drives more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating jobs . &quot;
&quot; in Turn@@ halle , however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots funding .
&quot; in the next step of the process , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Office of the Agricultural Council . &quot;
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg clinic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of staff go from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cil@@ ess Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on it will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the In@@ ner In@@ ner station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; upgrading &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer for internal medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree , both houses will lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ en@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , shall finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurbish@@ ment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , was confronted with ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what I conclude . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not happen again , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been positively and understand@@ ably taken up by the staff . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as a chief physician for over 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was constantly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

Jag@@ dun@@ no with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ ce on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police reported . &quot;
&quot; after a shot of shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
identified by the det@@ ective police .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pf@@ alz
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old women of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who had been missing since Saturday .
&quot; in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was admitted to kill the young people and threw their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 year old woman who has been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violence .
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police told on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who in fact conf@@ essed the indication , is considered to be suspi@@ cious and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning , after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally revealed . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee allegedly gave the authorities a police inter@@ ro@@ gation that killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the atri@@ um on Wednesday , and the investig@@ ators put a burden on him . &quot;
the further investigation is intended to shed light on the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German housing market have long ago begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the final affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year , there will be 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units ready in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have been living for the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit which will grow from year to year .
&quot; currently some 77@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of information in WG rooms .
&quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ ur@@ king in the housing market . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has been declining for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; thus , the Basic tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive fiscal depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for the refugee shel@@ ters of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , with 184 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be extended . &quot;
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; there is practically no passing through to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of the Croatian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which entered into force on the same day make decent asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees go .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police had interven@@ ed in the morning the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border with Croatia .
&quot; most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet the border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary . &quot;
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 injured people .
shortly before the closure on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws define the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly built &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit regions &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
there are 13 families with small children and two older people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stayed there .
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers start to clean up with it . &quot;
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people left the road in the past few weeks .
the barrier gri@@ lles were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centers in the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by order of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge celebration on Sunday with the elevator , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor , Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly set off rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately presented his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; before that , we have only once cal@@ med down the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; Stad@@ ler said in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train towards Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , to make it possible after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try across the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was turned off before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a second @-@ bridge sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of assisting R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures to ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has promoted the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
cor@@ nerst@@ ones of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters &quot;
Konrad has all the hands full to do with the Refu@@ gee Pro@@ mis@@ ing .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen gang to provide quarters for thousands of refugees .
Con@@ rad has already got a grip on the chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great vor@@ ti@@ ces , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master@@ y . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in a he@@ ur@@ ish year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create districts for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator sets great expectations also in the ORF @-@ Action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels which are empty during the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it cannot be that lod@@ gings have to comply with a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the harmon@@ ies .
&quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was more successful in placing an accommodation , Konrad asser@@ ts with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asive power is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic any cost as they themselves stated .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
&quot; up to now , their own search for districts was not yet successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with the approval . &quot;
Linz demand a better parti@@ tioning
&quot; for the time being , the City of Linz is planning no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons concerned are currently unable to take these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an emergency , however , additional locations should be checked for their suitability . &quot;
the Minister of Justice critic@@ ises the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) conducted further action on Monday in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are the corresponding border controls now . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
for P@@ ühr@@ inger this is &quot; a logical sequence &quot; from the German course of action .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general renovation of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is dra@@ fted , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology Division . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the intelligent heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ Companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later also to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million was invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is considered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focal point of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta W@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : after all , it has now grown in form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been re@@ mod@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; but I have thought for a long time whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the big area of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest brought Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women are looking for a beautiful hand@@ bag , the woman cannot answer with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it &apos;s because a nice bag of each outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are named An@@ ders .
some people also share this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants US President .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ups .
whether he expresses himself hostile to foreign journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the fres@@ her hair@@ style is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is related over -@@ ump@@ teen corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del shot a movie about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots , to which besides Tru@@ mp also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks to kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , it tends to be a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
&quot; the success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the foundation of the real estate company was the first real estate in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once had no permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared the start of the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had spoken repeatedly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er is rather distant from the Americans , &quot; he is always so angry . &quot;
does he believe Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated something for the church organ in a visit , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he won &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the Sa@@ gen at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. would have been like he , &quot; &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels Film , for which Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinema @-@ singers , also in the USA aw@@ akes the interest . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Charles Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sunrise aver@@ aged 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five capitals , compared to that of today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , in the last months Today , the gap to Sunrise is closed . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today saw an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed . &quot;
&quot; up to now , Sunrise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect the morning people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are ok , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter star Rebec@@ ca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and beat slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Sur@@ prise ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e in average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators , and in the second half an hour reached 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ seed will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute who did not manage to beat the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have apparently un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may inad@@ vert@@ ently give an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood holds his lips closed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game destro@@ yer will become who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
everyone named Je@@ ep &apos;s Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ ep &apos;s Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit made it clear last week that Wood &quot; the One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , W@@ ho@@ m should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls in the same way - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ gle as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conversion on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show its true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly reinforced Hay@@ ne at his press conference . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ ts@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his fake catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly was not the start which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL dé@@ but .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a pass took place in his own in @-@ go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free elec@@ torate calls for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high rate of refugees .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Congress in Groß@@ wal@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ van@@ ger warned against a serious crisis in Bavaria schools when there are no new teachers according to the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot;

the free elec@@ torate &apos;s parliament is held in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune until Friday .

but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free elec@@ torate .
&quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lay the law of asylum , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Security Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters away as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ red@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised the fact that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we would need uniform standards for federal states in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more handy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the country policy should not fall under the table in Gross@@ glo@@ stadt . &quot;
a lon@@ gla@@ sting long @-@ term burner remains on the agenda : the educational policy .

&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;

festive Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump to the jumps

&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police were rub@@ bing rubber back into a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i district , some 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; Bish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , executive district official , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before they res@@ or@@ ted on rubber back .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the deployed rubber floors , known by which they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ r@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re@@ built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter space .
&quot; a mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a land of approximately 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , trade and living . &quot;
&quot; one is waiting for appropriate offers , that is , on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor to question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no agreements have been signed . &quot;
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Grand Street , already a few months ago and the buildings on it can be torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the cottage settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor for the first time presented plans for the project for the first time .
several tra@@ ilers are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure agent
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , tri@@ mmed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new vacation rental on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System Construction , &quot; unveiled its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , who accused the investor and managing sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends from the system construction management went on the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
the pictures and new details on the desired hotel structure were causing violent reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the mer@@ rier and board member responsible for the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cla@@ p overlooking all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; moreover , like many other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there must be whole Bus inv@@ itations in order for that to happen &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what exactly is happening on the well one hectare site of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches bi@@ dding support campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google , Inc ( O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees over@@ roll by the European nations , as they are fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to disclosure of the don@@ ate call to his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager give notice , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had escaped with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations , up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / , will be doubled to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ e@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery study . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately immediately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded the diabetes condition and partially dis@@ b@@ anded in 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared to this , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also showed average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years , compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have firmly joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that increasingly attracts attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East would lie . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called on to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ orable , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , primarily through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and emphasized that the violent reaction of the US went on a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of ing@@ es@@ tion inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic palm dis@@ infection , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ infection in children under the age of 12 , reporting the poison control centres , rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them goes to emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children can intentionally drink dis@@ infection while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents allegedly bl@@ ended disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation in particular for small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison control centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the broad@@ ca@@ ster Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection agent within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from straw@@ berry fragrance disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally en@@ gros@@ sed by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a medical emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah took her words and was not able to walk when she arrived in emergency room .
&quot; doctors over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trauma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and had hit his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ infection books and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities believe that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ infection agents and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police looked at the bel@@ ated plan as &quot; &quot; jury &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in case of a collision at the cross@@ bar between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and On @-@ Her@@ es , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been injured in a collision accident . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year old truck driver drove to the roundabout in the direction of the roundabout and it was too late that there were two vehicles ahead at the roundabout .
&quot; as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the case of accident @-@ related vehicles , there was a damage of around 10 000 Euro , the police reported . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

&quot; Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a short victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , making the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays down talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about discre@@ pan@@ cies at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insist@@ ed that he and his team mates were not under elevated control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ lls Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , because there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; at present , de Bo@@ er , an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men was followed by Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

&quot; the players coming in the summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season . &quot;

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won all , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of that kind have not won . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom , unemployment is rising . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January , about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places there will be a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be chosen will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I have told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against capital punishment . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to enter all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can contact for .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after police ch@@ ase @-@ ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist stayed dry when he talked the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt at a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , a few meters away from a police officer attempting to &quot; &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a home peace @-@ break incident in Pel@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals for the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards attempted to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , claiming that she performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt de@@ up@@ pers at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it was going on .
&quot; sometimes one re@@ acts , and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go about my head around , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do it , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man whom I will name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it becomes personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L conduct itself cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now considering them about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training level of the trainer was built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching meant that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ ist treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day that was so .
but it was also like that on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man was arrested after ex@@ iting the driver
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and a driver flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley Highway .
the police said the car driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver flight and reduced assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a scar@@ c@@ ely disgu@@ ised note to the Storm @-@ Team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ cker of his team and said that they were focused only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading coaches on his team gave him confident voice , as it meant they were worried that they were beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this time and again , I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring games when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact to Tac@@ tics a real focal point , and that has achieved the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . so he is probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny how this always emerges in this season of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night to our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sh@@ it .
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and not a point tension@@ ing ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s $ 200,000 deposit after Dru@@ gs ank@@ le &quot;
&quot; a man , who may be threatened with a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of Dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay , arriving from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly life @-@ long punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on a security deposit under the conditions that he gives his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reporting to the police every day and adher@@ es to an opening block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
&quot; in case of a collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver re@@ marked it too late , trying in vain to ev@@ ade the last moment to the left , as the police reported . &quot;
the cab driver &apos;s cab is completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; the result was a damages of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as she was asleep , log@@ ged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through and found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed their mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed the computer found under the address and found &quot; concerning &quot; web resear@@ ches that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
&quot; after his talks with the unknown person , he was asked to send the pictures to him and he asked him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and weeping . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have accepted illegal images of children on the 14th of June last year , and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked for H@@ og@@ g to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his disappearance . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up off the border check@@ points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many bad people left out of fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure of people at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the federal police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the river districts of Passa@@ u and the Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and st@@ ow@@ age to the German side .
they will be received at reception by the Federal Police and forwarded for registration .
&quot; at the Munich Central Station , there were clearly more refugees arriving after the start of the week in comparison with the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ am , around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone , a spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , distributed the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong Deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; who has moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ se@@ abed with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun will again be visible again . &quot;
the mass is making it : every two years the motor@@ ways show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , there is a lot of movement among the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : according to the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone , around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by this segment alone in August . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel introduces a new entry under the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra already costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offers other diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only available in five @-@ door versions . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be added next to the Astra at the IAA or to new compact cars ?
Renault Meri@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as five @-@ door in a conventional and accentu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he joined the trade as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was primarily modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the rear @-@ mounted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison sentence Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision issued on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for money if they were confined within confined spaces within a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer , had been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his position in office because of the in@@ ven@@ erable detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
but the judges took up the verdict of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and returned the case for further examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity wounded .
chamber Jud@@ gement now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of liability for compensation are decisive for compensation , it was said to be an equ@@ ation of compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Jud@@ gement must now clarify the amount of the money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judge has often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
so they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which issued an in@@ decent housing to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the former complain@@ ant was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Kar@@ lov@@ y case . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to fights it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ est@@ elle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 should fall in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what to do in Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments yearly - and the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much , as has been built so far ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing are out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the viewpoint of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 public apartments would have to be created every year , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; says Mig@@ rant researcher Dietrich Bern@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence duty , the asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view has predominantly prevailed that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
&quot; up to now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the construction of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Road to Work Integration . &quot;
&quot; Berlin &apos;s school administration found that only a few refugees leave their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; it is important first of all to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ell@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared in the classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ amp from Berlin &apos;s school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees wish to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle no federal asylum seek@@ er or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Dom@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a refund or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive benefits after the asylum seekers salary law , when they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of bene@@ fici@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually enter into the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot;
the rights also include obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be a topic of the whole society much more than today .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade . &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and public authorities .
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long called for and for what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism law Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical support for the refugees expected so far , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create it , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand over health cards right away . &quot;
provided services could later be calculated with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to pick up so many people with the limited power catalogue that the Asyl@@ um Score Law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors will first of all make the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more educated about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs have to be taken over , it demands . &quot;
but many refugees have also helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugees , for instance , there are clearly more people with disabilities , and the young people are dealing with HIV / AIDS . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors come from their education but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and as for the health care centre , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , and some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee boy is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death fears . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght , and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ologically ill people seeking asylum in the social offices can apply for a psych@@ otherapy , however , it usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in social welfare offices mostly non @-@ personnel or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether or not a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to incorrect estimates , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on a brick , a v@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my Circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , T@@ rash and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto stands the current management of the man@@ e . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the family &apos;s gift lies in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; cocktail cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm . &quot;
even the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to easily record the Cuban duo . &quot;
ease and ag@@ ility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and arti@@ fici@@ ality . &quot;
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little other and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitudes of cir@@ c@@ als are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at her position as well : &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us too . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are lovingly called , are read off by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel good , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
the top commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if there are five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are with our whole heart . &quot;

Zimbabwe : Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread over social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions of the opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to join Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ enbach .
&quot; last month , they had pro@@ pped him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that immunity will end in the Parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to de@@ construct 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and service business activities .
&quot; expected job cuts lead to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP stated in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; , &quot; an explanation of the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the place of birth of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , which is based on the conviction that closely focused firms provide a better performance . &quot;
FC Ar@@ senal captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation progres@@ sed according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optim@@ istic scenario suggests that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of its history his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd registers 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ senal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs , which have experienced most of the vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s rice , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a counter@@ f@@ eit period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
Ar@@ senal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger turns out a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ senal is clear favourites , advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , measured on the Richter scale of 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that ar@@ senal has withdrawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by the distant hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in Ar@@ senal .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desp@@ airing than ever has become , as self @-@ mor@@ ot@@ ates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , focusing on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even though in reality isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments while watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can definitely relate to them , even if they often sit back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y care told me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are sel@@ fish , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone people may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest celebrating the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say Hello . &quot;
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , Maria meets on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ win Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ pla@@ on on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani got a header in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk even in group A , Paris requires a strong start to the Swedish champion , as they are not only aiming for qualifying for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , who could last weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing door was described as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind Malm@@ ö defense before joining Joh@@ an Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , which hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack . &quot;
&quot; instead PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ances and bad shut @-@ downs , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who p@@ atz@@ te in the first half alone and then abandoned after the re@@ boot of Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , whom Di Maria turned into a shot , which was ste@@ ered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole . &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth season &apos;s gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö was able to return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi described a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the skill games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; the Mining @-@ Ri@@ ese Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , which is affected by falling raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge redemption plan . &quot;
&quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core company , registered in London , said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth around € 1.6 billion to pay off its own debt . &quot;
&quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn is pressing demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange when trading on Wednesday morning .
&quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core last week announced $ 2.5 billion of stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion $ debt .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the U.S. President and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders have bilateral talks .
&quot; President xis visits will be given the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese co @-@ operation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi give the opportunity to construc@@ tively tackle areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet in Seattle several U.S. technology leaders on their way to Washington before traveling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi can address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged Cyber@@ spi@@ on@@ age China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played FC Barcelona back then . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times tro@@ phy winner , four times champion League winners , two times champion world champion , two times champion of champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already standing before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; at that time Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in memory : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows what Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 ran with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria across the entire distance on the grass , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays down variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in filling the film and not in the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian continued to consolidate . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown included the producers &quot; Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white hal@@ low . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People featured on the film for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; &quot; at the end , their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ age teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to use discrimin@@ atory practices against the illegal content . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned the first champion
&quot; professional sport clim@@ ber and user guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Kamer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had revers@@ ed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth relay , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the final place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the wins lost a chance to climb within a half @-@ season of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ sie . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw every game in the bul@@ l@@ head , and so I want to concentrate entirely on the game . &quot;
&quot; the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he sw@@ ung the wood well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ sie . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( impact training ) , saw clearly better in the bul@@ l@@ head , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ ds Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ d@@ Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy rus@@ hed down wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who captured a two @-@ run from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the major league the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
&quot; after adding an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , Detroit made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es to the start of the game .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I got off and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hed left a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z introduced Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; on the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he was not very well beaten , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strike outs . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter boxes .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Han@@ se@@ an state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , after data from the government president responsible for the initial survey , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he proposed the European states &quot; collective way@@ far@@ ing . &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive boost of international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again insp@@ ected controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary nobody will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , has returned no refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route . &quot;
their aim is mostly Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit next week . &quot;
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers intend to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee resistance in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support countries more strongly in the initial absorption and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot;
Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection .
&quot; but if you have no perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia in the night to Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be closed with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking cre@@ denti@@ als over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , for e@@ ye@@ witness accounts , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice @-@ tail of the Saturn moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ aps . &quot;
this is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
the moon is therefore easily stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring plane .
&quot; although this tac@@ tical movement is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the field &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 Cass@@ ini had discovered ice volcano at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles , thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; the expansion of the hidden , however , was not clari@@ fied . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München for several weeks
around one month the 1860 München must abst@@ ain from offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an investigation caused an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old divided the association .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lions , the diagnosis is estimated for four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; that makes us difficult , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible obligation of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; the ability to prove his ability . &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again next week . &quot;
&quot; even on Thursday , the Austrian National player should enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a hef@@ ty collision at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a severe bl@@ ur . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. E@@ specially contain man@@ gos but a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who eats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when you buy , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the peel @-@ color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it moder@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney adju@@ sts well to fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the U.S. parcel service U@@ PS supplies up to 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the United States .
&quot; the company has already begun with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are looked for . &quot;
&quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries delayed the parcel service of harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first fo@@ ils tower , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps of the Alps , the hair dryer breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz cleared on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night for Thursday , the F@@ öhn is blowing partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ iled pe@@ eler . &quot;
&quot; after gro@@ oming on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind arches and a temperature back . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
&quot; on the night@@ side of the Alps , during the night , the hair @-@ dryer breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn is blowing up until Thursday morning in the bo@@ oming valleys with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and in particular in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öhn can penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair @-@ dryer ensures summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow down at the mountain@@ side . &quot;
&quot; here , rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has to be accounted for after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the blow dryer leaves the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind dev@@ ours strong to stor@@ my temperature , and temperatures go far back . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the weekend . &quot;
Rome has now a Martin Luther place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing scheme was requested by the Association of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in secret by centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place will become visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he found the city as a resp@@ ectable sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
his negative impressions should have encouraged him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ la@@ vement .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the major works made by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with sump@@ tuous illustrations . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 pictures his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which , however , is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book &quot; &quot; all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles were created which focus on themes such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or father@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he has immediately fascinated several partners : the same applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ af@@ rust , who has devoted himself on painting with the respective scriptures . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation in question . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the ruler . &quot;
&quot; then the education took place already with the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work this up , perhaps to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art more promin@@ ently in the quick@@ est possible time : &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today shaped by public@@ ity , and that is loud . &quot;
symbo@@ lism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; into the images , let them look at them , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ st@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , also mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ af@@ ast : &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which opens on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railways close
&quot; plans made , space found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round trip : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway , it was finished again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused a sensation , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill slo@@ ping down , searched for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first congregation saw Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without a &quot; further pause . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its engagement for refugees up to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football is re@@ acting to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in cop@@ ing with the problems that are facing .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say that it doesn &apos;t work me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am at the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football couldn &apos;t help and wanted to help .
but the decisive course must be the policy .
&quot; therefore , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal authorities also support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will support the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor company logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen CEO Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler told the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we football Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their own places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP executive officer will lose eye in case of accident
&quot; according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye through a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood @-@ bloo@@ ded , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ fe &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday speech ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
it is important to get up once you &apos;ve fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes das@@ hed to a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ eling with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga stand@@ alone against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its trunk to the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change at the position of the door .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller took the place of St@@ em @-@ keepers Roman brus@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel was open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ge statement of Mit@@ player Re@@ us , that the final suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps mid @-@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Ro@@ bot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany will be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Auto Show IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with industry representatives at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise in digital radio . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; check the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to employ around the world that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ ages human beings as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicle @-@ less vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot;
the value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA survey by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ational organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to completely rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could envis@@ age 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l tells team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current situation , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only strike in singles on the title from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision should be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys got to know it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; said the German coach , Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term scheduled sponsorship in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ em@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who initi@@ ates the final list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo was missing , and we became a European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to it , &quot; explained the fifth @-@ fifth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation on September 18 , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his position to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was against it because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ das . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has hardly looked at the history of fashion without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork for which much effort was practi@@ sed : to freeze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have carried 14 tonnes of material to Munich . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , delicate fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the designing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later , I bought them , of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was due to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en fashion house . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion , fashion played a major role , and was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewellery , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already handle half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery sector . &quot;
only they can carry the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been cut off . &quot;
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer on this path .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports still weak@@ en , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery factory in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we are producing ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Institute of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au , graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must first of all think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter newly rev@@ amped the historical snow@@ ball point . &quot;
the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres in some places .
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ championship in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry spell . &quot;
now she uses the lace tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a la@@ vis@@ h procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s top - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en top . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a re@@ fr@@ aming but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks &apos; family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
whoever plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI is ur@@ ging the economy to open wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned by steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the Group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population milking system . &quot;
&quot; following the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it as@@ signs a greater role in the market in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legally binding business environment and open the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the levels of mercury in large predat@@ ory fish , allowing consumers to understand a significantly higher dose of neur@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU work paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full growth to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury , that , on the basis of the still existing limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram in return for this e@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ sin@@ king of Kl@@ ein@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous diver@@ ting manoeu@@ vre that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic for humans .
&quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry writes on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury comes first of all through the burning of coal into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants run more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nationwide . &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been quoted in March from paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
