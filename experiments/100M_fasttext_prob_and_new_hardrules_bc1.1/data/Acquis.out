B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable to the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning hed@@ ging measures .
the aim of the safety measures defined in this Convention is the timely detection of diver@@ gence of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence of such a bran@@ ching through the risk of early detection .
in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the audit by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the material quantity for each material balance zone is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen for a certain period of time .
in carrying out these inspections , the Organization makes full use of the safegu@@ arding system of the Community in accordance with article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
when using their securing measures , the community will use de procedures and measures of the following types and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are determined and useful in supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock removed from the stock and the amount of stock ;
B ) the evaluation of the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Method for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) method for ass@@ essing sei@@ z@@ ure of non @-@ measured assets and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system that indicates the core material structure and the changes in this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone , for each material balance zone ;
g ) provisions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures to reimbur@@ se reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in the mining or ore processing .
B ) If ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , the Community of the organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) the core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The coll@@ ateral provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not possible or desirable , the association and the association will consult each other about the use of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in gram@@ mes - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es up core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention , by these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total amount of the core material delivered in the states at no point amounts to no more than
a ) A total of one kil@@ ogram of special foldable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ uria , is calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the free core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention , shall be processed or stored , precau@@ tions shall be taken for the re@@ application of the securing measures to that material .
the Community meets with the Organization of supplementary agreements necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in particular to determine how the procedures defined in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without amend@@ ment of the Agreement in the agreement between the Organization and the Community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization , based on the initial report cited in Article 62 , constitutes a consolidated inventory of the entire repository underlying the securing measures of this agreement in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory on the basis of the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization )
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action plan established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imped@@ ed by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the target of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be bound within six months of the coming into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the Central Bank in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the EE@@ A organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special Account &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is made up of funds held by the member states in accordance with this agreement , and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which shall be paid on request in the currency of the corresponding state to order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and deposited at the Office of the Organisation in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may be entitled to make payments before the aforementioned dates .
in accordance with the usual proceeding of the organization , the administrator accepts about proportional draw on the cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately .
in granting such loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC :
( III ) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special loan is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly inv@@ alu@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , which is considered , approved , and managed according to the procedures and practices which are considered for the purposes of the organization funded by ordinary funds of the organization , whereby the aim of this agreement is to be taken into account under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble .
the funds of the special account may not be used instead of the Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or a loan , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions which apply to the development loan granted by the organization ; thus , they are re@@ payable in 50 years at a rate of ten years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to be paid for this dial are to be paid directly to the organisation which it maintains .
each special loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which the origin of the funds is in particular given .
the proceeds from any special loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has specified at the time of the loan guarantee , may be the recipient of a special loan loss .
capital re@@ payments for special transactions are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the bai@@ li@@ ff will inform the EEC until full disclosure of all special transactions is provided by the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special transaction , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tor of the organization concerning this account statement .
after full payment of the special transaction , the manager of the EEC shall send a detailed report to the projects and programs funded by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out from the account recei@@ v@@ ables , the amounts paid in and out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
the EEC and the Administr@@ ators work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the complete edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the organization may , if necessary , do not enter into force , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be due immediately .
if the total amount of all payments made by the recipients is returned in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations resulting from it shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of their respective procedures .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a No@@ tification on the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two signatures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wording is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be ruled out , HA@@ T shall issue the following regulations :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large experimental plant , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a Joint Business in Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET &quot; ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET &quot; ) .
Switzerland has been involved in research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area concerned .
since extensive work has yet to be carried out until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to collect their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research , which have gained a higher priority due to the energy crisis -
this agreement is intended to enable each contracting party to benefit from unnecessary overl@@ apping through a merger of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , thereby achieving the common objective of this research , i.e. , the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it is extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
every time the parties accept a new program , it will take place in the programs listed in Annex I and II of the present agreement .
the association assigned in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- the exchange of personnel in the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories that cooperate with the Eur@@ atom program ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
as part of the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the contracting parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the states and companies or persons , herein@@ after called &quot; Association organs , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program .
with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland particip@@ ates in the agreement on the advancement of the present agreement on the promotion of the human resources exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Personal Exchange . &quot;
in view of J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the present agreement to the Joint Venture of J@@ ET whose constitution it accepts .
Eur@@ atom also concerns that Switzerland can become a contracting partner of any contract whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with the conduct of the Association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present Convention are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement must include , in particular , the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented at the most two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is aware of this task regarding all research and development activities related to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and addresses their T @-@ ness in the interests of both parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common objective specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure , the statute shall appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek to respond accordingly .
the advisory groups , which the VG research proposals demonstrate in view that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take this task with respect to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented in the committee of directors involved in the Eur@@ atom program by the director of one of the laboratories involved .

the VG position on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same shall apply to the Committee of Directors in the field of human resources replacement .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the works of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purpose of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom program according to this agreement is assessed annually to an amount that is at the cost of the Eur@@ atom program at the cost of Eur@@ atom &apos;s program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Enterprise as soon as this is established .
moreover , Switzerland as@@ signs an amount to the common company J@@ ET , which is to be determined according to the rules of the statute of this Joint Venture .
the financial contribution of Eur@@ atom to finance the work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on human resource exchange is calculated on the same basis which usually serves to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works that are made on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
the Commission shall inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount is intended to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned .
the Federal Council is paying the Commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are laid down in Annex III of the present agreement .

before any decision on the adoption of a new Eur@@ atom program , the parties are consul@@ ted within the framework of the articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time , subject to a period of six months .
in the form of a correspondence to the amend@@ ment of the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in order to simplify the procedure for adaptation of customs tari@@ ff desig@@ nations in the event of new amendments to the Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it also appears indicated to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I am asking myself to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force of 1 January 1978 .
I would appreciate if you would confirm to me the approval of your government for the foreg@@ o@@ ing .
I honour myself to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirm the approval of your government for the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the medium @-@ term financial state
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit transactions with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide an appropriate application .
the agreement could be concluded by the amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total amount limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deplo@@ y@@ ments in the member countries .
however , we are already mentioned below some conditions for which BI@@ S would be ready for use .
in any stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but not exceeding five years altogether .
in the event of the opening of the loans , as well as in case of any extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first dra@@ fts are not made before the end of one month after the end of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing dies would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taken into account with the bank &apos;s means , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who apply the BI@@ S at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit transactions with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am asking myself to give you the approval of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this writing .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance specified on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena cannot occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined for double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the blood @-@ body flus@@ hing in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time of standards .
according to the definition , an international standard product contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the re@@ agent di@@ lution in the last mixture in a series in which a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bulletin of WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard Ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary characteristics shall remain maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date on the label indicated on the label is based on the results of the feasibility trials ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .

the re@@ agents for blood group determination for international exchange should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has come about a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents that have been delivered have been kept from the laboratory for so long , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective portion ; others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each container has a black and white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or quantity of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
furthermore , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , has to contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ Rh@@ o blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .

in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH to facilitate the acquisition , compar@@ isons and evaluation of statistical data , in particular those of international trade ,
in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to cut costs which are caused by the fact that goods in international trade have to be re @-@ defined , re @-@ framed and re @-@ enco@@ ded during the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the standardis@@ ation of trade documents and the transmission of data ,
recogni@@ zing that the development of technology and the structures of international trade necess@@ it@@ ates essential changes to the Brussels Agreement of 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff scheme for the import of commodities into the customs tari@@ ffs ,
furthermore , in the sense that the degree of differentiation required by governments and the economy for customs @-@ tari@@ ff and statistical purposes extends far beyond that which is contained in the system to the aforementioned agreement ,
weighing that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations ,
in the calculation that the harmon@@ ised system is to be used for transport tari@@ ffs and traffic statistics of different types of transport ,
in the calculation that the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be accepted as far as possible into the systems used in trade for the designation and encoding of the goods ,
in DER A@@ wa@@ v@@ ature that the harmon@@ ised system is intended to contribute to a close relationship between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN DER SHA@@ KE , that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ised system and the International Invent@@ ory for Foreign Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations shall be maintained ,
in the calculation that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined customs tari@@ ff and statistics scheme , which is suitable for use by the parties involved in international trade ,
in THE assignment that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ised system to the development of technology and the structures of international commerce ,
taking into account the works submitted by the Council for Cooperation in the territory of the Cust@@ oms Service for the harmon@@ ised system in this field ,
