<seg id="651">C) In search of the Community, the organization is prepared to examine investment data, which considers the community as particularly vulnerable, to the premises of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="652">These data do not need to be materially transferred to the organization, provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="653">(a) i) The Organization obtains the approval of the Community and the States for the designation of inspectors for the states.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) If the Community exalts itself either against a proposed nomination or at any time against a separate nomination, the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternate names.</seg>
<seg id="655">III) In the event of the repeated refusal of the Community to approve the appointment of inspectors of the Organization which are obstructed due to this Convention, the Council shall discuss the refusal, following the Director General of the Organization, in the following referred to as "the Director General" - with the aim of meeting appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the organization can actually perform the duties incumbent upon them in accordance with their agreement.</seg>
<seg id="657">(C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i) are as low as possible for the possible harassment and disturbance of the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlining the inspection;</seg>

<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">The organization, based on the initial report cited in Article 62, constitutes a consolidated inventory of the entire repository underlying the securing measures of this agreement in the states, irrespective of its origin, and continues this inventory on the basis of the following reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organization)</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action plan established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the target of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be bound within six months of the coming into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the Central Bank in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the EEA organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement;</seg>
<seg id="734">"" "the organisation establishes a special account under the name" "" "Special Account" "", "which is made up of funds held by the member states in accordance with this agreement, and used (in this property the organization is referred to as" "" "steward" "" "), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement."

<seg id="751">The proceeds from any special loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services (ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator has specified at the time of the loan guarantee, may be the recipient of a special loan loss.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments for special transactions are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The bailiff will inform the EEC until full disclosure of all special transactions is provided by the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of payment of the special transaction, the caretaker teaches the EEC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external auditor of the organization concerning this account statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction, the manager of the EEC shall send a detailed report to the projects and programs funded by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
