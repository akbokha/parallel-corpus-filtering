this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you need further information on your disease or treatment , please read the package inserts ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psychological illness in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elation ) alternating with periods of normal tuning .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral ing@@ es@@ tion of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or treat mel@@ ted tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l is believed to be &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l acts like 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ r@@ ence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours compared to plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , to prevent re @-@ occurrence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of the patient were examined based on a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets and the solution to absorb ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger decrease in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than those who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , ag@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo for symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take in ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance and in the prevention of a new German@@ ic episode in patients who were mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes belonged to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weigh@@ ed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the risks .
in addition , the committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new German@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ el@@ eri@@ fied and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients with A@@ bili@@ fy are treated with signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , consideration should be taken to reduce or cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of an M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in cases associated with var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesi@@ rable Cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ ac@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with ag@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic active substances that allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ phen@@ uria , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing the glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and this is why similar dose reductions should be made .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; Met@@ aboli@@ sm , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ dable Met@@ aboli@@ sm .
considering the joint formulation of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects , and similar can @-@ reduc@@ ers should be made .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ i@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in the reproductive studies of the animal , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned against using hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole included a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ athy , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ gor@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
there was no medi@@ cally significant difference between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the adverse events reported in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or intentionally acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without consequence of death .
there is no information about the efficacy of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma gas connection .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine d- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ mg recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ G @-@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 1- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
when using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , D2 / D3 receptor li@@ g@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients attending the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in a glossy ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage using patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
additionally , in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in some cases did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l was considering the prevention of bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ regulation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours with &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in respect of eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver function impair@@ ment of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10@@ x of middle ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages led to positions of 3 and 11 of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine d- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ mg recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ G @-@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the processed tablets to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine d- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ mg recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ G @-@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in a glossy ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage using patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared to 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages led to positions of 3 and 11 of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ tig@@ m@@ acy and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by det@@ ecting adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy sm@@ elt tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( either prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ el@@ eri@@ fied and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , per@@ spir@@ ation and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ phen@@ uria , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing the glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to the sole application of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were administered intra@@ muscul@@ arly and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received intra@@ muscular control .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ers .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects , and similar can @-@ reduc@@ ers should be made .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .

the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under aria pre@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
there was no medi@@ cally significant difference between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred .
increases in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the adverse events reported in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvement of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of as@@ tig@@ m@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the observed average improvement from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who contributed to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in a glossy ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was observed in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in some cases did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l was considering the prevention of bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % bigger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ related concerns of mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; thus they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had been given anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine in the past three quarters .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any case or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abram &apos;s patients responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treatment .
if only women were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mono@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils count &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in case of sensory atro@@ phy grade 3 , the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no renewed abrasion cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils count again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual methods of anti @-@ em@@ itting and con@@ sti@@ lling methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the mother &apos;s treatment with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised against a sperm conservation before the treatment , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible bar@@ r@@ enness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) which can affect the transport complexity and the ability to operate machinery .
the most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer were reported once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abram &apos;s disease and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , tooth@@ ache , loose stool , op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the thor@@ ax , weakness of muscles , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ ul@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules @-@ active substance that promotes the con@@ formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bu@@ le and stabili@@ ses the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ blin@@ ded trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % because of metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in relation to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral Neu@@ rop@@ athy C 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or dis@@ semination of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than a solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean total dose for cum@@ ulative urine leak@@ age was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane leak@@ age bottle over a period of at least 1 minute ( 0.@@ 9 % ) .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the flow @-@ through bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the flow @-@ through bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete reset of the powder is done .
if any precip@@ itation or sin@@ king is visible , the flow @-@ through bottle must be inver@@ ted again gently in order to achieve complete res@@ us@@ sion@@ ment prior to the application .

member states must ensure that the holder is supplied with the following information and materials to the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores prior to the launch before the market launch :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport by patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also referred to as refer@@ ral drugs ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications can occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a loss of blood from 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his / her supervis@@ or if they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be given during the whole treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which em@@ powers them to form epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems , Ab@@ und@@ amed was compared to the refer@@ ral drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of O@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied under the skin of 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia induced by kidney problems , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were en@@ cir@@ cl@@ amed were uph@@ eld in the same degree as those received by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this will not cause allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that there was proof for Ab@@ und@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces fl@@ amed amed , will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued Medi@@ ce Dru@@ gs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg approval for the commerci@@ alisation of ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma receiving chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if bleeding @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger operating procedures requiring a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected drop in blood from 900 @-@ 1800 ml that cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease .
an increase in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can be observed over or below the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a suitable dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease .
in view of this ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a suitable dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ emia symptoms .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ yte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be kept 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ yte number has increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood @-@ preserved foods is required , should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme , so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who are diagnosed with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , vascular disease of the oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 @-@ 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ ance toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , the thro@@ cy@@ tic and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is due to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should consider epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ f@@ used ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly before the beginning of epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease .
furthermore , it cannot be ruled out that with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies epo@@ eti@@ n has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies of tumour tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it is possible for surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically determined epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ ag@@ ulated and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ oc@@ esis .

survival and progression were examined in five large controlled trials with 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n showed a more consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than with the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and with controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results relate to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels obtained following intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ ital fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa ) .

according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medical Use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receiving new information that could have an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce the risk of risk • by request by E@@ MEA
• Have a heart attack or stroke within one month prior to your treatment • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of drop@@ let formation in the veins ( deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) - if , for example , such blood cl@@ ots occurred .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the car@@ oti@@ des ( vascular disease of the oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests if necessary to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before the beginning of the therapy with Ab@@ sec@@ amed .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin was reported very rarely on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or rising levels of potassium , your doctor may contem@@ plate an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically manifest cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs caused by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
at present , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which has not yet been di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your red blood pigment ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your unc@@ e@@ amed dose to minim@@ ise the risk of drop@@ let formation ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events have occurred in the past ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in case you &apos;re a cancer patient , bear in mind that out@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and , under certain circumstances , can have a negative effect on the tumour .
if you expect a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly before the beginning of the treatment .
if your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medications or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread to two equally large inj@@ ections .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is applied in patients with high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like in the eye ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or receive injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches in the three days following the in@@ fusion .
for the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for ass@@ essing Ac@@ last@@ a .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those of plac@@ ebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures decreased by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other component .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients under Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney complaints , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ last@@ a &apos;s manufacturer provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , including information on how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ last@@ a throughout the European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Suppl@@ ement indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing help
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by offering acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended , as there are limited clinical experience for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) The dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ last@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age since data are missing for safety and efficacy .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as there are only limited clinical experience for this patient population .
before the beginning of therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia can be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid release of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone conversion , a temporary , occasionally sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry prior to using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients with dental interventions , no data is available whether the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced shortly after acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen with acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which manifested itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the plac@@ ebo group and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels that were below the normal range of fluctu@@ ation ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the hom@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the morph@@ ology @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a recently issued hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion area , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area were reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports relate to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in case of over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a significantly decreased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ last@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures reduced by 60 % compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hips and dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.1 % , the lower radius by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology for 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were removed one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pool .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the retention of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone @-@ architecture .
bone replacement marker The bone specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of study .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ last@@ a reduced 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. ) or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ale was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment increased BM@@ D compared to plac@@ ebo for all time points .
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment performed more than 24 months in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % in the neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in untreated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in comparison to the once weekly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at the disease &apos;s disease Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( average serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the mean age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to bas@@ eline for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in an observation phase .
from the 143 eyes treated with Ac@@ last@@ a and the patients who participated in the follow up study , the therapeutic response with 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron could be maintained during an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ -@@ 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination time t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h , irrespective of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a decreased clear@@ ance of the metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , nutrient @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
since severe kidney function problems ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) are only available with limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest not let@@ al active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
in dogs a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion was administered in 3 @-@ day @-@ intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose associated with the 6@@ x of the humane @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , administered at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose associated with the 7@@ x of the humane @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulative exposure , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common findings in repeated use were an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ phi@@ c effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity at doses above 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to decreased serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for medical drug products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect current predic@@ tions on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was achieved . • On request of E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and women &apos;s disease Pa@@ get .
dec@@ lining blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure becomes too fast , and new bone material is arranged un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure back to normal , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medications or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage your kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drink , please be concerned that in accordance with the instructions of your doctor , you may take sufficient fluids before and after the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before the treatment is finished with Ac@@ last@@ a If you are considering completing the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your nearest doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ last@@ a .

persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were reported primarily in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue , or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid release of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically current , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .

four studies were also carried out in over 7@@ ,000 patients , in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking .
the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of accompli@@ sh@@ ments on this field of application was difficult to assess .
the most common side effects of accompli@@ sh@@ ments reported during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .

the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of accompli@@ sh@@ ments with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also include one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
accompli@@ sh@@ ments are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La depression disease or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
even in patients who - besides obesity in themselves - do not have any visible risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons ) are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months were excluded from trials with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

in addition , there are 3@@ 800 patients undergoing further indications in patients with obesity , as well as in patients with obesity .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in patients suffering from weight loss and accompanying metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ ebo ( for undesi@@ rable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undesi@@ rable effects &lt; 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very low l@@ ä

in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in plac@@ ebo after 6 months -@@ 0.8
the percentage of patients who achieved H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken re@@ mitt@@ ance 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m ar@@ z

patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n population @-@ mac@@ ab@@ etic analyses ( age range of 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old male has a 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old male .
5.3 Pre@@ ventive data on the safety of adverse events that were not observed in clinical trials but which occurred in animals after exposure in human therapeutic areas were considered potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be related to proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with the animals .
re@@ mitt@@ ance was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which permitted a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , thus no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ etic medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better set .
for more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos has resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels when applying the dosage of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ ness@@ ing showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % whereas the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and Insul@@ in in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing an account in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is inadequate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme parameters must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are located .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be derived from fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
as a consequence of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparison controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3.3 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ - or dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on a disease or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants to be pregnant or she enters , the treatment must be cancelled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ tas@@ er@@ inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated in this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents exceeding three times the upper limit of the normal range were similar to plac@@ ebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ phon@@ yl resin .
in an EN@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the launch it has rarely been reported on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more frequently when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events with respect to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study which lasted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) treated patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparable medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific cell recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose degradation in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide was continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first six months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic patients for 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol level as well as a slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol level were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced total plasma matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ al@@ az@@ one reduced values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both via an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized into groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma are normally achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the efficacy in roughly the triple of the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was mainly found in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans , and that of the entire active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies coinci@@ ded with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration plasma volume aug@@ mentation with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the formation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced in the rat .
in an animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ons resulted in increased incidence of color@@ ec@@ tal cancer .

the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ al@@ azi@@ one .
in clinical trials over 1 year , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both via an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered similar to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( see the complete list is the package contents ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ cord ph@@ ane were predomin@@ ant in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily when a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar level has significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy can alter the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus Insul@@ in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adaptation is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
prior to travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore take into account the possible interactions in the therapy and his patients always inqu@@ ire after other medicines taken from them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ c@@ tose in uter@@ o .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juices . • Heav@@ iness hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by means of a proven b@@ ail@@ out or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total working time is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ ing ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who are already showing signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or lymp@@ h nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , there are still some cases of rheum@@ atism , which is why it is recommended that patients continue to take further medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year in 7@@ 62 patients .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 m@@ g. a day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 out of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily received 120 mg taken a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case at 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 subjects under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic in the blood was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood compared to al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in ur@@ an@@ deposits ( including a medical history known or currently present and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
for patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or decentr@@ alized con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure is not recommended with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous drugs , it can lead to acute rheum@@ atism during treatment , as the reduction of serum acid pi@@ eg@@ els initially mobili@@ ses ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials slightly ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ otic treatment and in the further course according to clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was not conducted any interaction studies to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is well known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ene level ( inhibit@@ ing the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous offering of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen and other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study involving test subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medium , suggest@@ ing a potential weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not prec@@ lu@@ de the side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not prec@@ lu@@ de direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic , fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .

diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical trials no serious ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum acid levels were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditionally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study demonstrated the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering the serum acid level to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained persist@@ ently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum suppl@@ em@@ ination values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage response of serum acid levels in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study .
the data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a feed rate in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a si@@ delay ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out node , which resulted in 54 % of patients complete dis@@ appearance of the top nodes until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of serum acid concentration was observed , as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 , and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ depl@@ eted F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an un@@ altered dose of fat ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as unchanged f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
specific patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 @-@ fold from 7,5 μ g / h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / h / ml in the group with severe sei@@ sm@@ ur@@ ry function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in elderly patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , in about 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , which were about 4 times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which was accompanied by a reduction in in@@ breeding performance and a delay in evolution in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , roughly the 4.3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , did not result in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical trials no serious ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum acid levels were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a feed rate in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a si@@ delay ) .

liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to normal liver function .

in some people the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration at low by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is reached .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other constitu@@ ents of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart failure or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) .
if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat sensation and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before starting with the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be so , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months if you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be you other medicines if necessary to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medications or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use pharmaceuticals that may present one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may consider necessary measures . • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood di@@ lution in heart diseases )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on traffic imper@@ me@@ ability and the ability to operate machinery .
therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC only after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
on the back@@ side of the bli@@ ster pack , the individual week@@ days are printed , so you can check whether you have taken one tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those receiving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data to indicate that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( stomach upset ) , pit@@ ched abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and sour b@@ umping .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components .
it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on the one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract other than p@@ yl@@ or@@ la@@ sty , can only be given with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore be aware of all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be informed on the occurrence of symptoms of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain when swal@@ lowing or re@@ juven@@ ating heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , there were rarely ( after market launch ) Magen@@ to and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly contain intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available , which indicates whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a jaw @-@ surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to the beginning of the therapy .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also oste@@ opor@@ osis patients reported it .
nevertheless , absorption of serum calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum levels of ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with a similar incidence .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side @-@ effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ gen to vitamin D3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia may lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic persons .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate The therapeutic level@@ ness of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study to post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day in proportion to plac@@ ebo 8 years 8.@@ 8 % in the spine , 5.@@ 9 % in the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction in the plac@@ ebo group ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more fluid frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D of verteb@@ ral column and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to hold ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before recording a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically important change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distri@@ butions of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is distributed temporarily in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV dosage of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively marked substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the waste .
after an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or bas@@ al transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems .
res@@ or@@ ption With healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the average area under serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) was 29@@ 6.@@ 4 n@@ g • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D3 levels ) .
the average maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time until the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) was 12 hours .
biot@@ ope formation vitamin D3 is quickly hydro@@ xy@@ gated in the liver into 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
elimination of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects was the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the rot@@ ting after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although there are no clinical data available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly elevated accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is to be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

advance is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , and the application was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a period of one year ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and examined , as Adv@@ ant@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ mus antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ ant@@ f may not be used .
patients and physicians must be careful when other drugs ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken simultaneously using the adv@@ ent , as the an@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lead to transplan@@ t rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; adjustments to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Advent should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; )
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 systemic exposure was comparable to both ni@@ er@@ en- and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lat@@ tice are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under advance to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate transplan@@ t phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clearance agent , an adjustment of the Advent can plan can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral ing@@ es@@ tion of medicines in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion solutions ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application The immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained in order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ent therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change after the transplan@@ t in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ent therapy should begin at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily dose of Advent , so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the full daily dose .
after a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to an an@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must start for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t At adult patients who are converted to advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with an@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal patients , was used in lung transplan@@ t patients with an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case of transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in specific patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function To maintain blood tal@@ kers in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atine level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
caution is required when switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to adv@@ agra@@ f when switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the aid of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lat@@ tice controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ al levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ent , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ ent is a drug with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the bas@@ eline levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood are usually found in the first time after liver transplantation in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; adjustments to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ant@@ f .
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ant@@ f to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with adv@@ ent may be avoided ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood because the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur also under advanced law .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S like headache , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while taking substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al agents such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; hence , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the levels of hormone exposure , it is particularly pru@@ dent to proceed with decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially l@@ essen the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of patients in transplan@@ t patients have no indication that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the case of uter@@ o exposition , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible det@@ ri@@ mental effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a re@@ born hyper@@ alkal@@ ine ( incidence 8 of 111 ) new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often be as@@ cer@@ tained not exactly because of the patient &apos;s disease and treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects listed below are often reported in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

as is known for other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) is often increased .
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ ent .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ties including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zed .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent restriction of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , oral Pro@@ gra@@ f &apos;s safety profile in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recent multic@@ enter study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it occurred in 2@@ 1,7 % of the cases for the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ t patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multic@@ enter study of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation demonstrated a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is metaboli@@ zed almost completely before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out by the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) to adv@@ ent was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) to the total daily dose .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ent is used to treat bleeding or to prevent hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into which it enables the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was examined .
in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ent in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages was rated &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in 86 % of 510 .
the most common side effects of adv@@ ent ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
advance may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for placing Adv@@ ate in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on location and degree of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ aging events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period of time .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , a proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to Factor VI@@ II , different in vivo recovery and have different semi @-@ precious times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to verify an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the dosage velocity should be directed to the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always immune to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of a modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , which is the greatest risk in the first 20 exposure times and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ s ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product , the re@@ occurrence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the majority of A@@ DR &apos;s patients were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which were previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE ine 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 days of exposure .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody ti@@ tr@@ es against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody @-@ level anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ ous gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions during the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has reviewed the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which required a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company receives its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) is affected .
this is a type of virus genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been changed in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene not found in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and the killing of the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who performed Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the abdom@@ en area , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors bring benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP to have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of a@@ a@@ ze twice a day is a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and quit as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ yst@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ yst@@ ore symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients reported that the a@@ ze had an increase in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving deser@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart@@ beat ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from con@@ genital glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary or vascular disease , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ ins across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as with long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ ot@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of termination of such treatment .
this is attributed to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ d@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be performed per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ lation of r@@ hin@@ oc@@ ar ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ oline etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data did not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of a@@ a@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data did not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be performed in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , caution is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze must be deposited at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines will otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ ins during pregnancy is not assured , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , a@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impair@@ ment of transport capacity or ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ al processes .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drought , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the antibody molecule P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ine on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard meas@@ ur@@ ings of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage may cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of a@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under one mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of a@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the ab@@ rupt effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single @-@ dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ot@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of a@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ de lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four volunteers of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent for exposure after an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ ent@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150@@ mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drinking or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness was measured by investigating the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ g@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after 6 weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take the tablets and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were examined , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom sever@@ ity ) by 25 to 32 % , compared with the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two trials of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the reduction of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing on the market of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease procedure and can be terminated after the symptoms have ended and can be resum@@ ed upon re@@ occurrence .
in the persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy period for continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it may lead to light @-@ di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impair@@ ment of transport capacity or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to those treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered ( nine times the clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the antibody molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tivity towards endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. daily in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard meas@@ ur@@ ings of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , nar@@ ration and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall outcome of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been sub@@ stituted for further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms despite the a@@ eti@@ ology and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , this will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of bo@@ d@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n in vivo does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of an infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years are fully metaboli@@ zed and experienced a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children from 2 to 11 years , which is metaboli@@ zed fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se themselves normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , which is why patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not boo@@ sted by the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 3 % reported more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us compared to those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose trial involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times the clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who responded to an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily di@@ lor@@ at dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between the age of 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
at an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents performed in clinical trials for no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ om@@ otor system .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the con@@ current intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment or an increase in sleep@@ iness .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , nar@@ ration and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total volume of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of bo@@ d@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children from 2 to 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max around 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 different single dose studies showed that AC@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with recommended doses with those of adults who received the Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III Bra@@ ung@@ ing bottles with a child safe polypropylene seal cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate can be taken to absorb without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , compared to those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times the clinical dose ) were used .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was tolerated well and documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard meas@@ ur@@ ings of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , nar@@ ration and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall outcome of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of sm@@ el@@ ting tablets once daily lay in your mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of sm@@ elt tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the disinf@@ ect@@ ant sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , the A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the decreasing formulation of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically
in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard meas@@ ur@@ ings of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian patients ( A@@ wak@@ ening 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
the form@@ ulations were bi@@ a@@ qui@@ valent in single @-@ dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional pills or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in conjunction with dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets supports the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in small children aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult populations .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also vary depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and
as demonstrated by the total volume of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the load caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this fully metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us has the same concentration of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was needed and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and tablets .
in different single dose studies , NSC 631570 and C@@ max values of Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with recommended doses with those of adults who received the Des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

the 150 ml pack@@ et size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. formally informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company receives its application for the authorization to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic emerges when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human beings because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus present in the vaccine as &quot; foreign body &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was cleaned up with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign bodies ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspection of some of the study centres indicated that the study was not conducted in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked what an@@ tivi@@ ral medication the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines twice a day .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ a is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV levels in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not curing aids , however , can delay damage to the immune system and therefore also the development of associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral drugs , but without k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase enhanced with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ e@@ as@@ ut@@ ors earlier .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml under plac@@ ebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a reduced viral load , but only a few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , led to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks compared to patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed for more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are broken down just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines against HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh@@ ed the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee stated that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing generic gases in the European Union .
in combination with anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ a capsules are to be given for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the reinfor@@ cing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg of pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions at 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use should be exercised with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction ; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be informed that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with AIDS , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the event of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of this medicine .
patients with pre@@ existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing &apos;s disease and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the nar@@ rowing of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of a@@ generic ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the kind of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored for om@@ pi@@ ate removal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl cone content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this form of dosage is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous ha@@ emat@@ oma and ha@@ emat@@ thro@@ sis .
HIV infected patients with severe immunity may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms at the time of initiation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial a@@ eti@@ ology ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cycl@@ ine 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate for the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were frequently observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the sprinkl@@ ing mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies dos@@ ages of 600 m@@ g. of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan .
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that have been achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ cide component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs were to be used at the same time , caution is required , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
when used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , thus increasing the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can result in absorption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced enh@@ ancements of the plasma levels can be expected while giving A@@ gener@@ a .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors since plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with an oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while with simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for om@@ pi@@ ate removal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adapt the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so also alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time given by A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether the inf@@ on@@ avi@@ r exceeds the breast milk in humans .
a re@@ manufacturing study of pregnant rat rats , which was administered from the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight in the offspring during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of the offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of the dam to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , rose early and rarely led to treatment interruption .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and occurred in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation ( Sti@@ cks ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral individuals who were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ din / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed only one case ( Sti@@ cks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 performed in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients in am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be interrupted with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
HIV infected patients with severe immunity may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initiation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
patients receiving 600@@ mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were similar to those observed under general azi@@ one treatment ; one exception was the increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K levels , which were observed very frequently in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the relationship between the Activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .

the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clinical validation systems can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples associated with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross resistance to k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral infections previously untreated ( one of them referred to a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ auf@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early aband@@ on@@ ment of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the proof of efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which adults treated with PI ( twice a day ) and nucle@@ o@@ side ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis was the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ grade threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ roasted A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mer@@ ase should be taken into account in the optimization of therapy in the case of PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) reaches the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the seem@@ ing distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia which represents the active part remains probably unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ium remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosing interval in relation to the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ational solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram @-@ base .
the ren@@ al clearance of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of kidney dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
these treatment schem@@ as lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas associated with male animals occurred in doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vial and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse @-@ mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment .
studies of toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed a high mortality both in the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus patient navigation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the reinfor@@ cing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg of pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be exercised with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction ; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set aside for the duration of 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that have been achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
when used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dosage is 31 , although there are no clinical data available .

with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to an acceptance of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study of pregnant rat rats , which was administered from the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in body weight in the offspring during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ranges from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ auf@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ say should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children who are previously treated with PI .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ium remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosing interval in relation to the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .

the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to inhal@@ e ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for the intake and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adaptation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for taking in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a consequence of the high prop@@ yl alcohol content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for taking in small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be informed that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ a , does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .

con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and result in related side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am expects a significantly higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for inhal@@ ing may not be used during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl eng@@ ly@@ col it contains ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether the inf@@ on@@ avi@@ r exceeds the breast milk in humans .
a re @-@ production study of pregnant rat rats , which was administered from the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in 55 body weight in the offspring during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .

early aband@@ on@@ ment of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mer@@ ase should be taken into account in the optimization of therapy in the case of PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;

- If you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . − This medicine has been prescribed for you personally .
it can harm other people even if they have the same complaints as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effect of adren@@ al .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above conditions or taking any of the above drugs .
if your doctor recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure you have carefully read the instructions on k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before the beginning of the treatment .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for enhancing effect in children aged 4 to 12 or in general for patients under 50 kg of body weight .
it is therefore important that you read the section &quot; When taking generic ase with other medicines , &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase .
you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control an@@ a@@ emia . − In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur .
if you use certain drugs that may cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize possible safety problems .
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
traffic imper@@ me@@ ability and operation of machinery There were no studies on the impact of A@@ gener@@ ase on driving ability or the ability to operate machinery .
please take this medicine only after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
if you are using Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of A@@ gener@@ ase can be reduced .
dosage of A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
if your doctor determines that taking k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
85 So it is very important that you take the whole daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you .

• The application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected skin areas so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo were performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • At the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies combined with bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ os@@ tic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday ( Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible tendencies have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment time the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are not completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed skin area in the clean@@ sed skin until the cream is completely absorbed .
there should be a balancing between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible ag@@ gra@@ vation of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing up between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies where no daily in@@ timacy was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a stri@@ k@@ hole leading to circumcision .
when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection methods for the treatment of external asc@@ ents in the genital and peri@@ anal area has not yet been clinical experience .
although limited data indicate an increased rate of up@@ war@@ ency products in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of their fav@@ ors .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during the therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period of several days can be done .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months are available after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is required for patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the application is not recommended for tum@@ ors previously treated .
data from an open clinical trial indicates that there is less chance of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of acute ey@@ eli@@ ds on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip .
very limited data is available about the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed less complete recovery rates than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after a unique nor repeated topical application , serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been quanti@@ fied , there is no recommendation to use during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions at the site of treatment of the fav@@ ors ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly possibly or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study were shown below .
the most common side effect , probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , was in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects specified by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
this evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan often shows that these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often lead to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cur@@ ation / fl@@ apping ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this assessment of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe Er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe decay and em@@ bodi@@ ment ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental oral intake of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , corresponding to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most severe side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid dosage .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was possible to demonstrate that the efficacy in regards to complete curing of the inc@@ ess@@ ences during an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment .
at 60 % of the 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients were completely cured ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % from 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ os@@ tic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acts within a co@@ hesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the admitted indications exterior fav@@ ors , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and num@@ bed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application four months also yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice when it was administered three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the place of application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not suspected , there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors were in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ es ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( genital organs ) and anus ( anus ) are a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
if untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people exposed to sunlight during their previous lives .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in the face and scal@@ p of patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for the infection .

if your skin respon@@ ds too much to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist .
a reduced number of blood cells can make you suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue stain at your feet or it can cause a feeling of fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) .
most of the time these are lighter skin reactions which res@@ end within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment is stopped .
occasionally some patients notice changes at the location of the application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , skin destruction , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I. ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , ag@@ grav@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with recovery devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in urine and regarding the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed for more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion place .
frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year and update it whenever necessary .
the producer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will see patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ erst@@ ock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I. ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any related side @-@ effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only occur in an adequate clinical setting , in which re@@ vit@@ alization devices are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies to form against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , it is necessary to proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used con@@ currently with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mostly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
undesi@@ rable drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , difficulty breathing and visual e@@ dem@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients under 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a slower progression in the patients under 5 years ( on average after 26 days vs 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature withdrawal from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to present antibodies that were det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ o @-@ precip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients who had never been converted to serum conversion .
patients with lacking to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG@@ s in urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es a variable reduction of G@@ AG@@ s was observed in the urine .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal until low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undesi@@ rable drug reactions , even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulation of enzymes is based on the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated Sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the blood circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via male @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study affecting the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected feedback and the absolute walking distance in the 6 minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement in lung function and ability to be cured in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as indicated in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ ac@@ alie prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG @-@ mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
overall improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was carried out , primarily examining the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to elevated G@@ ag@@ - mirrors in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe form @-@ form only limited or no progress was to be found in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ as were carried out on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks is an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that in elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers for humans .

the holder of the authorization for placing on the market has completed the following program of studies within the given time , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase containing certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small quantities before or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other drugs please inform your doctor if you take medicines containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicine , including prescription medicines .
indications for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion solutions must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians or medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , difficulty breathing and facial oil .
very common ( occurrence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Joint disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased heart rate • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion place
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package inserts will be updated .
if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it should not be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that di@@ lution was done under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Accor@@ ding to body weight of the individual patient first determine the number of th@@ inn@@ ed bottles .
A@@ lim@@ ation is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( or malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body , or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer who does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ation is used in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies as sole therapy .
to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ation and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ medication &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given .
in patients whose blood flow changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dropped or the dose is reduced .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ation in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ation was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ation was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ation for longer survival compared to the comparison drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each flow @-@ through bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is removed from the flow @-@ through bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for over@@ sized plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the second @-@ line treatment of patients with chronic or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for over@@ sized plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed gift and on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a minimum of 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake needs to be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first dose of emet@@ re@@ xed as well as after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created before every gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 , N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 .
if patients fail to develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before the treatment .
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- an abnormal toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at age 65 years or above , in comparison to patients aged 65 years there is an increased side effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 45 ml / min , which exceed the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1 to 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone res@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils count again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was considered when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic action to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ inflammatory cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with py@@ tel@@ emet@@ ric ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients intended for a treatment with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to the treatment , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with py@@ tel@@ emet@@ ric ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
for this reason , patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid retention in the trans@@ cellular space should be considered to be drainage of the eff@@ usion prior to the refrac@@ tory treatment .
5 Major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by means of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised against the treatment regi@@ men to seek advice on the preservation of the sperm cells .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ cal ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in a decreased rate of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses for patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage should be avoided for at least 2 days prior to the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed .
the high in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy except when it is mandatory and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by means of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be informed before the beginning of the treatment to seek advice on the prevention of sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed exceeds the breast milk and unwanted effects of the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .

E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in relation to the common C@@ is@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy obtained medi@@ an survival for patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months to patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival results in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) were similar for patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin Com@@ bin@@ ation against gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3,@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28@@ ,@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = a intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ subordin@@ ate limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ eti@@ n ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed as mon@@ otherapy were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found unchanged within 24 hours of the application in the urine .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed has a total capacity of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs , which had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ mal epitheli@@ al tissue ) .
unless applied , the retention periods and conditions after the preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution took place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
dissolve the content of the 100 mg vi@@ als bottles with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed .
the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the product quality .
each flow @-@ through bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
23 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring extends from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients taking All@@ i and unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , making about a quarter of the fats inflic@@ ted with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to plac@@ ebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving all@@ i 60 mg were reported to have an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study of All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed for more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on after , fl@@ ur@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with step lab@@ eling , bow@@ el movement , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or on cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for the weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ calcium , reduced @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ bed , the dosage is not necessary for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients • Premature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adjusted if necessary .
patients taking all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or an elevated cholesterol level should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage must be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally Norm@@ alized R@@ atio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the injection of one dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of reported adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
most of the cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose have either no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dosage of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human and animal studies , a rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects attributed to the lip@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect begins in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in residue of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ as .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 indicate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ calcium , reduced @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest loss of weight in the first 6 months occurred .
mean change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
mean change in LD@@ L cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 Gener@@ ally , not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was generally spor@@ adi@@ c and extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and no signs of accumulation .
two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified in a study of obes@@ e patients , with approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

if you miss a meal or a meal contains no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional complications ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule collection with a calorie and reduced @-@ fat diet .
food di@@ aries are effective , as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier for you to change your eating habits .
in order to safely achieve your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• E@@ at low @-@ fat to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional complications ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Rem@@ ain while taking and even after stopping the intake of all@@ i physically active .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional complications : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a reduced fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial Nach@@ tisch@@ Nicole as you possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms appear , learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) attached to this pack .

sustained weight loss , e.g. by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat healthy .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
which amount is appropriate for you , see the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal on a daily basis , for example through 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and also adhere to them . • Sinn@@ fully is a nutritional diary containing information about the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calorie and fat reduction and give guidelines to become more physically active .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the pot@@ ency of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an antibiotic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong respectively moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no ret@@ ort in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 out of 2@@ 21 ) .
chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids prescribed before chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy drug , Alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents examined against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron intraven@@ ous dose and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Sem@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience of the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events reported at a dose of 250 mc@@ g ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi , were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted because of the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin ( half @-@ life of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given , which was given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared with patients receiving 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously every day .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials on the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular deport@@ ation and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ally half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration period curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after the intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the enzymes in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures which are considered sufficient beyond the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies there were indications that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans .
the EU Commission must inform the European Commission of the plans for placing the medicine approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue exhibits damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s efficacy was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

there were also concerns that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed did not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease rose again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug has an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ z@@ ings ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because of this type of infection it may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body surface for patients under 18 years of age .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had ended after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients suffering from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients in plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with hom@@ tw@@ asser , about 90 % of patients in both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go weigh in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected minor in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensi@@ bili@@ sation or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped off and appropriate alternative treatment of the infection started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , the efficacy of retin@@ ol was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on a sc@@ rub@@ bed skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment on a sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dos@@ ages are not considered necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retina o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy , when topical anti@@ bacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ir is prefer@@ able to a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the therapy should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to balance the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections which Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most frequently reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the location involving about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ir is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ally inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer centre .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partially P @-@ binding site interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of retin@@ ulin at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences were found in the in vitro activity of retin@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and stri@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adults before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the final application .
however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans was 6@@ 60 times lower than the retina ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g / ml ) .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ aboli@@ sm in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days showed signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of s@@ me@@ ared skin ) :

Ambi@@ ani is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ ani is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered .
therefore , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a refres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hepatitis B or B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines act as they &quot; teach &quot; the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ ani contains the same components as the registered V@@ acc@@ ine of the Twin V@@ acc@@ ine which has been approved since 1996 and has been the registered V@@ acc@@ ine of the Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan existing in three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adult were also used as a test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
ambient conditions led to the development of protective antibody concentration against hepatitis A and B in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ ree &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 doses of vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ rix consists of two imm@@ uni@@ zations , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a booster as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer trac@@ eable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine there should always be available options for medical treatment and monitoring immediately .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with mal@@ functions of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody in these cases , so that additional doses may be required in these cases .
since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication in the glut@@ eal muscles , these injection routes should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , however , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously as it can lead to bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved .
in a clinical trial which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ om@@ ers and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 imm@@ uni@@ zations between 1 and 15 years of age .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ ree &apos;s tolerance was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per in@@ oc@@ ulation dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a basis for calculation per person .
pain was observed at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects after the injection of Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % in the test subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix were reported to have pain , over 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % in the test subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the frequency of mat@@ ernity , however , was comparable high per test volume ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects received Ambi@@ rix ) compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ urities was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study for 1 to 11 years of vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination process with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted with vacc@@ ines aged 1 to 15 years , the dose rate for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % was 1 month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose of the month 6 ( i.e. , month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose administered to the month of 6 ( i.e. , month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ ani and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the serum @-@ dis@@ infection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was administered significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the in@@ oc@@ ulations received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme could be demonstrated in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of the basic dimm@@ ing .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the booster @-@ chim@@ ing of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stuff and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as swimming in waters contaminated by waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require hosp@@ ital@@ isation .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before administration of both doses Ambi@@ ree ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that affect the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of your face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you wish to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
in case of a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of active ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle in persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots . • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child is undergoing a ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines ( including those you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received / has or planned this in the near future .
it may be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ on pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not given , unless it is urgently required that they are vacc@@ inated against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) at your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ ani is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the initial authorization for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP points out that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ ree has been placed in transport only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mo@@ p can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ ola could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a bo@@ g@@ us medication , i.e. without a drug ) .
am@@ mo@@ p can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ di@@ fication of blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste a@@ version , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mo@@ p in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented ammon@@ ia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information was available for this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually with regard to protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8@@ g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ in@@ takes .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ ni@@ fication associated with caution .
since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs through the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal reproduction and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thereby impaired brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease even resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen separation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and those treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ Q Tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible also in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following the intraven@@ ous dosage of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after intake .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a deficiency disorders or h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl acet@@ ate in plasma .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day ) in three single doses , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
secre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no plain@@ tive effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children , which cannot swal@@ low or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8@@ g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ in@@ takes .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ or of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are not reversible also in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after intake .
during the period of durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure includes the small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring sco@@ op of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out for you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disturbances , dis@@ appearance of hearing , dis@@ ori@@ ti@@ bility , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or your hospital &apos;s emergency room to initiate appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( abnormal readings in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in case of a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new incidents ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment .
in patients with PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the marketing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ fiel@@ ding inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous indication of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is carried out in another row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose can be reduced from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure a stu@@ b of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of an all @-@ certain Bol@@ us @-@ administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second position of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medication should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of a bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second tigh@@ tening dose must be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us was administered without dose adjustment with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ ox@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of ha@@ emo@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored for symptoms and signs of bleeding during treatment , especially if Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , most of the hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in arter@@ ial points of punc@@ ture can occur , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can perform bleeding during the treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the level prior to the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines with plat@@ el@@ et aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological h@@ emo@@ dynamic parameters are to be checked regularly .
the experimental studies are inadequate in terms of the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ date alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ id@@ ine group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 4 g / dl with known blood vessel , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ zations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasional ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ id@@ ine group as well as in compar@@ isons treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed in accordance with system organ categories in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din can immediately be canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre as well as in the ion bin@@ der region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is present in the liquid phase or at the cl@@ ots .
binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines with serum from patients in which it had come to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) were not induced to in@@ duce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reactions .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is confirmed by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional Bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ reconc@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ C changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as pep@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in his amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence due to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not work efficiently .
insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine is very slightly different from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter active life than a short acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged four to 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body of insulin is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ c@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection into the abdom@@ en area by continuous in@@ fusion .
due to the reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a disability of the liver function .
any change of the effective strength , the brand ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ ar@@ ded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in insulin requirements .
3 An inadequate dosage or abor@@ tion , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin belonging to another manufacturer should be performed under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the effects of sympath@@ is@@ ers such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin secre@@ tion enters human breast milk , but in general insulin does not pass into breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
listed below are the adverse drug lists known from clinical trials ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; often : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is neglected to continuously change the injection point within the injection molding area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a appropriately trained person , or by a doctor by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous levels of insulin , the action occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , insulin lu@@ li@@ sin@@ ess in the therapeutic relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin@@ ess has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ ency effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the human insulin .
it was clear from the data that in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine was taken 2 minutes before the meal , better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ial control than with human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal was achieved .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin@@ ess for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal @-@ mal@@ igned , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
