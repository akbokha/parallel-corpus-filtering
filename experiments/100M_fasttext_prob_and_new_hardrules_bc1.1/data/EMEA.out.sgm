<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information on your disease or treatment, please read the package inserts (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiry thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) alternating with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to inhale or treat melted tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripibozol is believed to be "partial agonist" for receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripibozol acts like 5-Hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripibozol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent re-occurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify Injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared to that of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in the symptoms of the patient were examined based on a standard dial for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the smelting tablets and the solution to absorb (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger decrease in the symptoms of increased unrest than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, agbilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo for symptoms of increased unrest and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take in (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance and in the prevention of a new Germanic episode in patients who were mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes belonged to the treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed vis-à-vis the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new Germanic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripibozol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acelerified and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients with Abilify are treated with signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, consideration should be taken to reduce or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of an MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in cases associated with varicose seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable Cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketacacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with agbilify and other atypical antipsychotic active substances that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, Polyphenuria, Polyphagie and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripibozol on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripibozol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripibozol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and this is why similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'poor' Metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibozol compared to CYP2D6 extendable Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint formulation of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibition with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Iconconazole and HIV proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects, and similar can-reducers should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in ariiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripibozol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextrometphic / 3-methoxymorphinan Ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrometphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in the reproductive studies of the animal, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole included a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathy, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripibozole and 15.1% in patients under Ogorapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">There was no medically significant difference between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The adverse events reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentionally acute overdosages with Aripibozol were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without consequence of death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of haemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose because Aripibozol has a high plasma gas connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripibozol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine d- and serotonin 5mg receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5G-2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripibozol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D1- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">When using Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term trials (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients attending the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripibozol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl Group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a glossy apin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% versus the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripibozol showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage using patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripibozol showed a superior efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Additionally, in week 12 Aripibozol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not apply to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripibozol resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripizole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripibozol was considering the prevention of bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a relapse in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyregulation of Aripibozol, the N-Dealkyulation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours with 'poor') Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic study schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in respect of ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripibozol and Dehydro-Aripibozol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on liver function impairment of the pharmacokinetics of Aripibozol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety macology studies, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and canogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical-toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10x of middle steady State exposure (AUC) at recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of Sulphate conjugates of Aripibozol in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripibozol found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages led to positions of 3 and 11 of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify smelt tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the effectiveness of Aripiprazole Injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripibozol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxicity (either prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripibozol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acelerified and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, perspiration and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, Polyphenuria, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the sole application of Aripibozol, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripibozol (15 mg dose) were administered intramuscularly and the simultaneously Lorazepam (2 mg dose) received intramuscular control.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripibozol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">With CYP2D6 'poor' metabolers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolers.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Iconconazole and HIV- Proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects, and similar can-reducers should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosis) received intramuscular strength, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the only dose of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were commonly reported in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under aria prezol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">There was no medically significant difference between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (Kreatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The adverse events reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant improvement of detachment / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detachment and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of astigmness and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Loracepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe detachment, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term trials (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients who contributed to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%.</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripibozol (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In a glossy apin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was observed in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% versus the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not apply to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripibozol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripizole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripibozol was considering the prevention of bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a relapse in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole AUC is 90% bigger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazole Injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application there were no safety-related concerns of maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripibozol (oral) for safety macology, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and canogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans; thus they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of Sulphate conjugates of Aripibozol in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages led to positions of 3 and 11-times of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, some of which had been given anthracycline in the past three quarters.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in any case or as monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abram's patients responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel treatment.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only women were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other paclitaxel drugs to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the marketing of Abraxane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not shown (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In case of sensory atrophy grade 3, the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies have been conducted with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which could have significantly other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed abrasion cycles should be initiated, until the neutrophils count again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was not proven, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there is nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual methods of anti-emitting and constilling methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except the mother's treatment with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised against a sperm conservation before the treatment, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible barrenness.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) which can affect the transport complexity and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer were reported once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in the pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abram's disease and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagie, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, toothache, loose stool, ophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thorax, weakness of muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimulotubules-active substance that promotes the conformation of microtubules from the tubule and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumreceptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) occurs a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-armed unblinded trials and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% only had adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastatic disease and 19% because of metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity in relation to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral Neuropathy C 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or dissemination of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane administration (43%) than a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean total dose for cumulative urine leakage was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane leakage bottle over a period of at least 1 minute (0.9%).</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the flow-through bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the flow-through bottle should be swivelled slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete reset of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If any precipitation or sinking is visible, the flow-through bottle must be inverted again gently in order to achieve complete resussionment prior to the application.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packaging inserts. • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product, refrigerated boxes for transport by patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also referred to as referral drugs).</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which complications can occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a loss of blood from 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be made by the patient or his / her supervisor if they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be given during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which empowers them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">As part of a major study of 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems, Abundamed was compared to the referral drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Oprex / Erypo were studied under the skin of 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study of patients suffering from anaemia induced by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were encirclamed were upheld in the same degree as those received by Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this will not cause allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that there was proof for Abundamed according to the provisions of the European Union that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces flamed amed, will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued Medice Drugs Pütter GmbH & Co. kg approval for the commercialisation of abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma receiving chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if bleeding-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger operating procedures requiring a large blood volume (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected drop in blood from 900-1800 ml that cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients, where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease burden; therefore, the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can be observed over or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this haemoglobin variability, a suitable dose management should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Initial dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week with intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease burden; therefore, the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this haemoglobin variability, a suitable dose management should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the control of anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticuloyyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose should be kept 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticuloyyte number has increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticuloyyte number has increased by ≥ 0,62 mmol / l three times a week, the dose should be kept from 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticuloyyte number by &lt; 0,62 mmol / l compared to the baseline value, response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), where the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood-preserved foods is required, should receive a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation programme, so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who are diagnosed with any erythropoietin in erythroblastomenie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive abseamed or other erythropoietin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, vascular disease of the otides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effect, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1-2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminance toxicity, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the Reticulocytes "Index"), the throcytic and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow to the diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit, which is due to the gift of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased via the concentration required for the control of the anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary artery disease or congestive insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">Tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should consider epoetin alfa a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transfused).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients intended for larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be investigated and treated accordingly before the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies epoetin has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies of tumour tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in regard to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischaemic attacks, deep venous thromboses, arterial thromboses, arterial thromboses, retinal thromboses, retinal thromboses, retinal arthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoietin treatment, it is possible for surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonates or any other component.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients under Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney complaints, reactions to infusion and osteonecrosis (dying of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta's manufacturer provides clarification material for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, including information on how to apply the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted the company Novartis Europharm Limited a permit for the marketing of Aclasta throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Supplement indication in pregnancy and lactating women • Required for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing help</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.U. of orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) For patients with a creatinine-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Aclasta is not recommended, as there are limited clinical experience for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) The dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age since data are missing for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Creatinine Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), as there are only limited clinical experience for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Before the beginning of therapy with Aclasta, an existing hypokalemia can be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid release of the effect of zoledron acid on bone conversion, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry prior to using bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients with dental interventions, no data is available whether the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecroses in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced shortly after acetamol or ibuprofen with acetamol or ibuprofen (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">The overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable in the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which manifested itself as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinine-Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the placebo group and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels that were below the normal range of fluctuation (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the hombus-Paget-studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the study on prevention of clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the morphology-Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on prevention of clinical fractures after a recently issued hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion area, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the jaw area were reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecroses (primarily in the jaw area) that were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports relate to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study of 7,736 patients showed osteonecrosis in the jaw area of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7.736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without any signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures Aclasta significantly decreased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of spinal fractures reduced by 60% compared to placebo-patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures Aclasta showed a constant effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk for hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at the lumbar spine, hips and distal radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.1%, the lower radius by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology for 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were removed one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pool.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison to placebo a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo and the retention of the trabecular bone-architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale Propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not measured routinely but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U.) or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortale was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased BMD compared to placebo for all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment performed more than 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment to increase BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% in the neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in untreated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once yearly dose of alendronate in comparison to the once weekly dose of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at the disease's disease Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (average serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the mean age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedron once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to baseline for Aclasta and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in an observation phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 eyes treated with Aclasta and the patients who participated in the follow up study, the therapeutic response with 141 of patients treated with Risedron could be maintained during an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ -0.24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination time t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h, irrespective of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the Zoledron-acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased clearance of the metabolized substances by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, nutrient-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 examined patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a creatinine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney function problems (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) are only available with limited data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest not letal active intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">In dogs a 15-minute infusion was administered in 3-day-intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose associated with the 6x of the humane-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), administered at intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose associated with the 7x of the humane-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulative exposure, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in repeated use were an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorphic effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity at doses above 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to decreased serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients with metformin (a diabetes drug). • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphonyl harnsubstance or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulphonyl resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better set.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1,400 patients, the efficacy of acettos in tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels when applying the dosage of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dose of actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulphonyl harnessing showed a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94% whereas the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and Insulin in 289 patients, patients receiving actos in addition to insulin, showed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing an account in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which metformin is inadequate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirror is elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme parameters must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are located.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be derived from fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a consequence of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparison controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3.3% and haematocrits by 3.1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulphonyl harn- or dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, Thiazoldindionen, including Pioglitazon, was reported on a disease or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants to be pregnant or she enters, the treatment must be cancelled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon, and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductaserinhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in 54% reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000; &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, ALT-ascents exceeding three times the upper limit of the normal range were similar to placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an ENcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch it has rarely been reported on congestive heart failure under pioglitazone, but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events with respect to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study which lasted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) treated patients treated with pioglitazone compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific cell receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose degradation in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide was continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first six months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetic patients for 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol level as well as a slight, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol level were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced total plasma matriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels under pioglitazone, while under metformin and Glicalazone reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this both via an effect on the triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of immutable pioglitazone in the plasma are normally achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the efficacy in roughly the triple of the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, pioglitazone has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon, and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of pioglitazone in humans, the marker was mainly found in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours for humans, and that of the entire active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies coincided with mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia resulting in the formation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced in the rat.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazole indions resulted in increased incidence of colorectal cancer.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined with Pioglitazone or Glicalazione.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglyceride, but also improved postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this both via an effect on the Tryglyceride absorption and the hepatic Tryglizeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study found the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the overall mortale, non-fatal myocardial infarction, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials slightly abnormalities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the febuxotic treatment and in the further course according to clinical findings (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas not conducted any interaction studies to Febuxostat, but it is well known that the XO inhibiting can lead to an increase in theophylene level (inhibiting the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous offering of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily associated with an increase in Febuxostature (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies, the use of naproxen and other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving test subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 medium, suggesting a potential weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacid, containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not preclude the side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not preclude direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic, fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostats compared to the Allopurinol group in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with febuxostat could be detected.</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage response of serum acid levels in subjects regardless of their kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed a treatment against a feed rate in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of the patients needed no treatment against a sidelay).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout node, which resulted in 54% of patients complete disappearance of the top nodes until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the Cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-depleted Febuxostat, about 49% of the dose was found in the urine as an unaltered dose of fat (30%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as unchanged febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Specific patient groups of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in proportion to normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased about 1.8-fold from 7,5 μ g / h / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g / h / ml in the group with severe seismurry function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, in about 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of specific Purinmetabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was found that Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4 times of human-therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, which was accompanied by a reduction in inbreeding performance and a delay in evolution in the offspring of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking symptoms that indicate an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was found, there were rarely (after market launch) Magento and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and with complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1320">In the group treated with alendronat, a 48% reduction in the placebo group (alendronat 3.2% versus placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more fluid fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of BMD of vertebral column and Trochanter continued to hold; also the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">It consisted of two placebo-controlled studies in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg. a day over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study the daily dose of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new eddy fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Based on an intravenous reference dose, the average oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before recording a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability increased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% if alendronate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, oral Prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) led to no clinically important change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 Distributions of rats have shown that alendronat is distributed temporarily in soft tissues after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly circulated into the bone or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After IV dosage of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate about 50% of the radioactively marked substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the waste.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After an intravenous dose of 10 mg, the renal clearing of alendronate was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acidic or basal transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other drugs through these transport systems.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Resorption With healthy adult subjects (women and men) after the administration of ADROVANCE the average area under serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) was 296.4 ng • h / ml (without taking into account endogenous vitamin D3 levels).</seg>

<seg id="1336">Characteristics of patients with preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate, which is not deposited in the bone, is quickly excreted over the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although there are no clinical data available, the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal experiments can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, in patients with reduced kidney function, a slightly elevated accumulation of alendronate in the bone is to be expected (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus can lead to transplant rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; adjustments to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advent should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level provisions (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advantf, the Tacrolimus-Talking should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 systemic exposure was comparable to both nieren- and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus lattice are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under advance to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a low clearance agent, an adjustment of the Advent can plan can take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the condition of the patient does not allow oral ingestion of medicines in the first post-operative phase, the Tacrolimus treatment can be intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of infusion solutions) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of application The immunosuppression must be maintained in order to suppress the graft rejection; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - Kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advent therapy should begin at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change after the transplant in the course of the patient's stabilization.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advent therapy should begin at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advantf must be converted to a transplant receiver of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules on a once daily dose of Advent, so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the full daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a conversion from other immunosuppressants to an anagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplants must start for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant At adult patients who are converted to advance, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with anagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal patients, was used in lung transplant patients with an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case of transplant recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in specific patient groups Patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood talkers in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine level, a calculation of the creatinin and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Caution is required when switching from Ciclosporto to advagraf when switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in the individual case with the aid of full blood Tacrolimus lattice controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus-Talal levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to advent, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could alter the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since advent is a drug with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the baseline levels of Tacrolimus in full blood are usually found in the first time after liver transplantation in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; adjustments to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has proven to be a therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advantf to prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with advent may be avoided (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood because the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septum hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur also under advanced law.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overload and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES like headache, altered state of consciousness, cramps and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while taking substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Iconconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibition; hence, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can interfere with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the levels of hormone exposure, it is particularly prudent to proceed with decisions on contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of patients in transplant patients have no indication that, compared to other immunosuppressants, an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In the case of utero exposition, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible detrimental effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advent.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasties including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors associated with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacogenic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent restriction of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, thereby preventing the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (like interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.3% within the first 24 weeks of the advance group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234).</seg>
<seg id="1473">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for advanced and 90.8% for prograf; 25 (14 women, 11 men) and prograf arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) died.</seg>

<seg id="1475">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for advanced and 96.9% for Prograf; 10 (3 women, 7 men) and prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advantf were compared in combination with Basiliximab-antibody production, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of treatment failure after 12 months (defined as death, loss of transplant, biopsy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advancing Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advancing vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 lung transplant patients, in 475 patients who underwent a pancreas transplant and in 630 cases were used as primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, oral Prograf's safety profile in these published studies corresponded to observations in the large studies where prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recent multicenter study with oral Prograf was reported to over 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterate syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus it occurred in 21,7% of the cases for the development of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients encircled by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred was 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplant patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the development of a bronchiolitis obliterate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter study of oral Prograf was performed on 205 patients undergoing pancreatic and kidney transplantation following a randomised procedure tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric trial with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplantation demonstrated a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, which lead to Talking between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations, leading to an increase in the unbound faction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is metabolized almost completely before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly carried out by the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) to advent was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice a day) to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus-Talal levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advent is used to treat bleeding or to prevent hemorrhages in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency which causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into which it enables the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was examined.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of advent in the prevention of hemorrhages was rated "excellent" or "good" in the prevention of hemorrhages in 86% of 510.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advent (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advance may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to Baxter AG for placing Advate in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on location and degree of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhaging events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period of time.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, a proper determination of the factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to Factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semi-precious times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out in order to verify an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosage velocity should be directed to the patient, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always immune to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of a modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates to the extent of exposure to factor VIII, which is the greatest risk in the first 20 exposure times and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTs) with more than 100 exposure-days and anamnestic known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII-product, the reoccurrence of (lower) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The majority of ADR's patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which were previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels was observed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE ine 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), a FVIII inhibitor was detected after prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study, 5 of 25 (20%) treated patients with ADVATE treated inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody-level anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, uritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilous granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions during the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has reviewed the benefit-risk assessment as positive but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the safety profile of ADVATE, which required a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company receives its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been changed in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene not found in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and the killing of the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who performed Li-Fraumeni cancer in the abdomen area, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injections of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors bring benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP to have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed substance release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeropaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aaze twice a day is a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and quit as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes in the severity of the haystropathic symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all haystore symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients reported that the aze had an increase in the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aeropaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving deserloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aeropaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heartbeat), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosaze may also not be used in patients suffering from congenital glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), urinary or vascular disease, hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension).</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aerins across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), aeropaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as with long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper airways, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerotephedrine contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of termination of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributed to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, liddroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be performed peroral or nasal as ablation of rhinocar (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazoline etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data did not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aaaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data did not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be performed in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, caution is recommended: • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerosaze must be deposited at least 48 hours before performing dermatological testing, since antihistamines will otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Lloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with Lloratadin and those treated with placebo, regardless of whether Lloratadin was alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloatadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerins during pregnancy is not assured, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases, it may lead to a dizziness that may lead to impairment of transport capacity or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth drought, pupillary rigidity and dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the antibody molecule P-selectine on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study involving adults, Desloatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurings of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympathetic effects, such as increasing blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerosaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aaze tablets was significantly higher than under one monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aaze tablets with regard to the abrupt effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Lloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single-dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerotaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of Lloratadin, 3-hydroxyde loratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four volunteers of the loratadin were badly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent for exposure after an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety macology studies, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Lloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Lorentadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The Pharmacovigilance System described in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerosaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and drinking or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerotaze: • High blood pressure • Heart hunting, palpitations • cardiac arrhythmias • nausea and headaches or strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">If used in the recommended dosage, it is not expected that aerosaze leads to dizziness or decreases the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aerotaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aerotaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take your dose of Aerotaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, get it as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloatadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling noise, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation, and cases of conspicuous liver disease has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablets, 5 mg lyophilisate for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg of processed tablets (tablets dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children from 1 to 5 years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children from six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness was measured by investigating the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrangles, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after 6 weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to take the tablets and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were examined, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom severity) by 25 to 32%, compared with the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials of Urticaria, the reduction of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Lloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing on the market of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of diloratadin in young people aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current disease procedure and can be terminated after the symptoms have ended and can be resumed upon reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy period for continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with Lloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases, it may lead to light-dizziness, which may lead to impairment of transport capacity or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg, compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with diloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study in which up to 45 mg of Deschloratadin was administered (nine times the clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the antibody molecule P-selectivity towards endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg. daily in a dose of up to 20 mg. daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurings of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, narration and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall outcome of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been substituted for further forms of Urticaria because the underlying pathophysiology is similar in the different forms despite the aetiology and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in addition to the chronic idiopathic urticaria, this will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving preitus and the reduction of size and number of bodles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with Desloatadin in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which patients demos were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Lloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily use of Lloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloatadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloatadin in vivo does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with diloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of the loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with Lloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Lloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional safety macology studies, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Lloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independent of meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of an infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children from 2 to 11 years are fully metabolized and experienced a higher substance load (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. formally informed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company receives its application for the authorization to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic emerges when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human beings because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus present in the vaccine as "foreign body" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus was cleaned up with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign bodies), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "inspection of some of the study centres indicated that the study was not conducted in accordance with" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment, please contact your attending doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but this cannot be taken together with kritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked what antiviral medication the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with 100 mg of kritonavir and other antiviral medicines twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenera is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the HIV levels in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not curing aids, however, can delay damage to the immune system and therefore also the development of associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without kritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase enhanced with low dosed kritonavir was compared with other proteasinhibitors in 206 adults who used to take proteasutors earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken a proteasinhibitor, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml under placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenera reduced viral load, but only a few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteasthenia, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, together with kritonavir, led to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks compared to patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed for more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are broken down just like Agenerase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years outweighed the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee stated that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with kritonavir in patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited for placing generic gases in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">In combination with antiretroviral drugs, Agenerase is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenera capsules are to be given for pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir together with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Ampriavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not replaceable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of kritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenera capsules is 20 mg of prenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenera in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be exercised with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction; in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be informed that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment with AIDS, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenera capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant medical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with preexisting reduced liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and kritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's disease and suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the narrowing of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of ageneric ase with lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalized Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is insufficient to assess the kind of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is also given with amprenavir at the same time, patients should therefore be monitored for ompiate removal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propyl cone content of the Agenerase solution, this form of dosage is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to 5 in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including proteasinhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, there are reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous haematoma and haematthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">HIV infected patients with severe immunity may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms at the time of initiation of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial aetiology (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenera must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isocycline 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolized predominantly via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir leading to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate for the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were frequently observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ampriavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the sprinkling mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nelfinavir is given together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax by 30%, when kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies dosages of 600 mg. of amprenavir were used twice daily and kritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of amprenavir in plasma that have been achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and kaletra cannot be given, however, a close meshed surveillance is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study for the use of Agenerase in combination with Didanosin, but is recommended due to the antazicide component of Didanosin that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs were to be used at the same time, caution is required, since Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and kritonavir to Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous injection of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, thus increasing the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69times in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if used together with Agenerase, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as Agenerase as it can result in absorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-convulsiva, known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, ni</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption with Agenerase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, Agenerase with kritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced enhancements of the plasma levels can be expected while giving Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with Ampriavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors since plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with an oral Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while with simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for ompiate removal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adapt the amprenavir dose if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so also alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time given by Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, amprenavir related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether the infonavir exceeds the breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A remanufacturing study of pregnant rat rats, which was administered from the embedding in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight in the offspring during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of the dam to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was investigated in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, rose early and rarely led to treatment interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with taking Agenerase or any other medicine used to treat HIV, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenera twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and occurred in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal fat accumulation (Sticks).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral individuals who were treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudin / zidovudin over a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed only one case (Sticks) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 performed in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients in amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be interrupted with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">HIV infected patients with severe immunity may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections at the time of initiation of antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients receiving 600mg of Agenerase twice daily with low dosed kritonavir (Grade 3 and 4) were similar to those observed under general azione treatment; one exception was the increases in triglyceride and CPK levels, which were observed very frequently in patients who received Agenerase along with low dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient can observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-polyproteins with the result of formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Ampriavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the Activity of HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other kritonavir-bleached treatment schemas with proteaseinase inhibitors - the mutations described were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral-untreated patients receiving 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of kritonavir twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of 13 out of 14 children, where virological failure occurred within 59 included patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of kritonavir twice a day: n = 107) with protease inhibitors previously treated patients occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Analysis based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defined resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I54A / L / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinical validation systems can be used in combination with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples associated with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain cross resistance to kritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir is generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral infections previously untreated (one of them referred to a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 insulates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amaufavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abandonment of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations, which can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with kritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which adults treated with PI (twice a day) and nucleoside (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis was the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subgrade threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unroasted Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was tested twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-dose kritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of patients enrolled in the study had plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19" "" "Based on this data, the benefit of" "" "unbundled" "" "ammerase should be taken into account in the optimization of therapy in the case of PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) reaches the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax by 30%, if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of prenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The seeming distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves on a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma, whereby the amount of unbound ammonia which represents the active part remains probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound ammonium remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates throughout the dosing interval in relation to the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 have to be administered cautiously if they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The dosage of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily prenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerational solution and Agenerase capsules are not replaceable on a milligram-base.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Out of the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 active lesions showed less complete recovery rates than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither after a unique nor repeated topical application, serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been quantified, there is no recommendation to use during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream related side effects in studies with three-week treatment were local reactions at the site of treatment of the favors (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and possibly possibly or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod cream treated basaliom patients from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study were shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common side effect, probably or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream, was in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects specified by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III patients with actin keratose treated with Imiquimod cream are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan often shows that these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod cream often lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excuration / flapping (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This assessment of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with imiquimod cream is very common to severe Erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe decay and embodiment (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of the actin keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental oral intake of 200 mg of imiquimod, corresponding to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most severe side-effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotony that normalized after oral or intravenous liquid dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferons and other cytokines have been detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it was possible to demonstrate that the efficacy in regards to complete curing of the incessences during an imiquimod treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the 119 patients treated with Imiquimod, the patients were completely cured; this was the case at 20% of the 105 with placebo-treated patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% from 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod during five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratostic, non-hypertrophic acts within a cohesive 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The admitted indications exterior favors, actinic keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actin keratose was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and numbed 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for the dermal application four months also yielded no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice when it was administered three days a week did not induce tumors at the place of application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not suspected, there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors were in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I. (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, aggravating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with recovery devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and regarding the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed for more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of pulmonary function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known each year and update it whenever necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The producer of Aldurazyme will see patients who receive aldurazyms with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the marketing of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I. (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyms may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any related side-effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only occur in an adequate clinical setting, in which revitalization devices are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that virtually all IgG-antibodies to form against Laronidase are usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, it is necessary to proceed cautiously due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medicines (antihistaminika and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, serious infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used concurrently with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over the mother's milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mostly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug reactions related to Aldurazyms observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, difficulty breathing and visual edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients under 5 years, with predominantly severe follow-up form and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a Serokonversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a slower progression in the patients under 5 years (on average after 26 days vs 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature withdrawal from the study), 13 / 45 patients were unable to present antibodies that were detectable by radioimmuno-precipitation (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients who had never been converted to serum conversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacking to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAGs in urine, while in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction of GAGs was observed in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal until low neutralizing inhibitory effect on the enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the hydrolysis of the accumulation of enzymes is based on the hydrolysis of the accumulated Substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion Laronidase is rapidly removed from the blood circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via male-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study affecting the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were from the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected feedback and the absolute walking distance in the 6 minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in lung function and ability to be cured in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as indicated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of 26 patients with a Hepatomacalie prior to treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant drop in the GAG-mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg creatinine) which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Overall improvement in 26 patients (58%) was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was carried out, primarily examining the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to elevated Gag- mirrors in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe form-form only limited or no progress was to be found in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacogenic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemas were carried out on the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks is an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimation and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin, a "anti-medication" (drug against vomiting) and fluids (to prevent liquid deficiency) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood flow changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, dropped or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimation in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimation was also compared to gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin showed an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimation was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients with cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimation for longer survival compared to the comparison drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each flow-through bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is removed from the flow-through bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for oversized plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the second-line treatment of patients with chronic or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for oversized plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is given intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is given intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid will be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift and on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, a minimum of 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake needs to be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first dose of emetrexed as well as after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created before every gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the Nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are to be applied for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0, NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients fail to develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ Level 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted by ALIMTA until the patient has the value before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA has to be aborted if in patients after 2 dose-reductio- an abnormal toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- fort on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at age 65 years or above, in comparison to patients aged 65 years there is an increased side effect risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinine-Clearance ≥ 45 ml / min, which exceed the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinine-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1 to 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone resuppression and Pemetrexed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils count again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 haematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic action to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pytelemetric (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients intended for a treatment with telemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days prior to the treatment, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pytelemetric (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For this reason, patients with clinically significant liquid retention in the transcellular space should be considered to be drainage of the effusion prior to the refractory treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since there is the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by means of telemetrexed, men should be advised against the treatment regimen to seek advice on the preservation of the sperm cells.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistical (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can result in a decreased rate of pemetrexed with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is recommended if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid can be used in high doses for patients with normal renal function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage should be avoided for at least 2 days prior to the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with pemetremixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use of telemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy except when it is mandatory and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since there is the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by means of telemetrexed, men should be informed before the beginning of the treatment to seek advice on the prevention of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed exceeds the breast milk and unwanted effects of the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomised Cisplatin and Pemetrexed patients and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared to placebo in 391 overweight patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients receiving alli 60 mg were reported to have an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study of Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed for more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily stains on after, fluratus (winch) with step labeling, bowel movement, greasy / oily chair, departure oily secretion (rotting), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for the weight reduction of adults with excess weight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocalcium, reduced-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimal resorbed, the dosage is not necessary for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients • Premature treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich individual meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic needs to be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients taking alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or an elevated cholesterol level should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-contraceptive measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally Normalized Ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the injection of one dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the data available cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of reported adverse events reported after the launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdose have either no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dosage of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, a rapid regression of possible systemic effects attributed to the lipinhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect begins in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin residue of gastric and pancreatic lipasas.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials for adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 indicate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocalcium, reduced-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest loss of weight in the first 6 months occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Mean change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">Mean change in LDL cholesterol with orlistat was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">Waist circumference was the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of not metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 Generally, not metabolized orlistat in plasma was generally sporadic and extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and no signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1, after cleavage of the N-Formyl-Leucine group), could be identified in a study of obese patients, with approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2574">Food diaries are effective, as you can understand at any time what you eat, how much you eat and it will likely be easier for you to change your eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">In order to safely achieve your target weight, you should set two daily targets in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Eat low-fat to reduce the likelihood of nutritional complications (see section 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment, as you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional complications: • Begin already a few days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a reduced fat diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Distribute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main court or a substantial NachtischNicole as you possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction. • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms appear, learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Keep out of the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find as indication of food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at maximum per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Note the tables below in this section. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Which amount is appropriate for you, see the information below, which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you. • Due to the capsule's mode of action, compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By adherence to the recommended fat intake, you can maximise weight loss and at the same time reduce the likelihood of diet-related side effects. • You should try to decrease progressively and continuously.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week without frustration and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher is your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you can burn 150 kcal on a daily basis, for example through 3 km of walking, 30- to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and also adhere to them. • Sinnfully is a nutritional diary containing information about the calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The potency of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, since there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong respectively moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no retort in 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 out of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 out of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd approval for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids prescribed before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can prolong the colon assay, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy drug, Aloxi is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents examined against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous Palonosetron intravenous dose and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Semxorubicin, ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience of the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, so Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events reported at a dose of 250 mcg (total 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi, were headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were conducted because of the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not effective therapy for an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin (half-life of 7.3 hours) were given, which was given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study 667 patients receiving a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron, were compared with patients receiving 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given intravenously every day.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials on the indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular deportation and repolarisation and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of palonosetron in individual doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminally half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration period curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportionally in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After the intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax after the one-time dose of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the enzymes in CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures which are considered sufficient beyond the maximum human-therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies there were indications that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also referred to as" "" "reference medicinal product" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination the liver tissue exhibits damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, Alpheon's efficacy was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http:</seg>
<seg id="2669">There were also concerns that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed did not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease rose again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug has an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug) is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected lazings (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because of this type of infection it may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body surface for patients under 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had ended after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients suffering from Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with homtwasser, about 90% of patients in both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective in treating abscesses (eiterfilled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo weigh in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, infected minor infirmities, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the marketing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensibilisation or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamine Salbe the treatment should be aborted, the ointment should be carefully wiped off and appropriate alternative treatment of the infection started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamine should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the efficacy of retinol was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on a scrubbed skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the mean Retapamine AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamine ointment on a skewed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dosages are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retina ointment should only be used during pregnancy, when topical antibacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamir is preferable to a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy should be continued with Altargo, it is necessary to balance the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections which Altargo used, the most frequently reported side effect was irritation at the location involving about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamine is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamir is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomally interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptide transfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partially P-binding site interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s-ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retinulin at least some types of infection appears questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in vitro activity of retinulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study 1% Retapamine Salbe was applied daily with occlusion on intact and striped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamine Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adults before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the final application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans was 660 times lower than the retina (0-24) = 238 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">Studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) performed over 14 days showed signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro review of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microkernel test for in vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of smeared skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryonic toxicity study on rats, orally dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (see above), developmental toxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (Version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorization for placing on the market is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for Medical Use," the updated RMP should simultaneously be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if you are not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, at the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment goes out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a roe tape unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambiani is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambiani is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Therefore, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix may be given or another hepatitis B or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act as they "teach" the immune system (the natural defence of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambiani contains the same components as the registered Vaccine of the Twin Vaccine which has been approved since 1996 and has been the registered Vaccine of the Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adult and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan existing in three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adult were also used as a testament to the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient conditions led to the development of protective antibody concentration against hepatitis A and B in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambiree's degree of protection was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 doses of vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambirix consists of two immunizations, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured, whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis C vaccination, need a booster as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no longer traceable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the administration of the vaccine there should always be available options for medical treatment and monitoring immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and individuals with malfunctions of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody in these cases, so that additional doses may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal implication in the gluteal muscles, these injection routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, however, Ambirix may be injected subcutaneously as it can lead to bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix in the second year of life was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thiomers and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been administered to a total of 1027 immunizations between 1 and 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambiree's tolerance was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per inoculation dose Ambirix, but not based on a basis for calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed at 50.7% of the subjects after the injection of Ambirix, compared to 39,1% in the test subjects after the dose of a 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix were reported to have pain, over 63,8% in the test subjects, who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of maternity, however, was comparable high per test volume (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects received Ambirix) compared to 36.2% of the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturities was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study for 1 to 11 years of vaccination, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccination process with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted with vaccines aged 1 to 15 years, the dose rate for anti-HAV 99,1% was 1 month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose of the month 6 (i.e., month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose administered to the month of 6 (i.e., month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambiani and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the serum-disinfection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the 3-dose vaccine was administered significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the inoculations received either a 2-dose-vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-dose-vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme could be demonstrated in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of the basic dimming.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the booster-chiming of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and Seroconversions as for the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspening on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that affect the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix, or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of your face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you wish to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of active ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected under the skin and not into the muscle in persons suffering from severe blood clots. • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense, or if you / your child is undergoing a haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines (including those you can get without prescribing) or if you have been vaccinated recently / has been given / or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have received / has or planned this in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may be, however, that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambion pregnant or breastfeeding women are not given, unless it is urgently required that they are vaccinated against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) at your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ A very frequent complaint (more than 1 case per 10 blended cans): • pain or discomfort at the puncture or redness • Matty • Irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ Frequently (up to 1 case per 10 injected cans): • swelling at the injection point • fever (over 38 ° C) • Headed dizziness • Gastro-intestinal disorders</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects reported that days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 inculated doses) have been reported:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally limited or extended rashes that may itch or vesicle, swelling of the eye area and face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden drop in blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like discomfort, including chills, muscle and joint pain, varicose attacks, dizziness, abnormalities such as tingling and "ants running," multiple sclerosis, disorders of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts, strong headaches and stiffness of neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>

<seg id="2803">23. inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed you / your child will significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package supplement.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Ambiani is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since the initial authorization for the placing on the market, the CHMP points out that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambiree has been placed in transport only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammop can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonschnaps - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered via a gastrostomy (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammonola could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a bogus medication, i.e. without a drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammop can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidification of blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste aversion, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammop in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammontaps was approved under "exceptional circumstances," because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information was available for this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for use if a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually with regard to protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or Ornithinintakes.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk for the formation of esophagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and odemnification associated with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs through the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of the neuronal reproduction and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thereby impaired brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate dose, severe hypokalemia, curb topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred during a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stoichiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease even resulted in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By haemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen separation (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and those treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of the OrnithinQ Transcarbamylase deficiency), who recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible also in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyrat is known to be oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidney, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following the intravenous dosage of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea deficiency disorders or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was no phenylbutyl acetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day) in three single doses, the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Secretion The drug is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had no plaintive effects with toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either orally (infants and children, which cannot swallow or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomy or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or Ornithinintakes.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat flutes were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metaboor of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramids of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate dose, severe hypokalemia, curb topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 to 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are not reversible also in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure includes the small measuring spoon of 0.95 g, the average measuring scoop of 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out for you, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrat may influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you should not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, disappearance of hearing, disoritibility, memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you encounter any of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or your hospital's emergency room to initiate appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you forgot to take AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood image (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, discomfort, weight gain and abnormal lab results.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You can no longer use AMMONAPS according to the expiry date specified on the carton and the container.</seg>
<seg id="2874">As AMMONAPS looks and content of the pack AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval shape, and they are provided with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>

<seg id="2876">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS on equal single doses of orally or via a stomach fistula (hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (hose which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Put a heaped measuring spoon of granulate from the container. • Strange a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess granulate.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (abnormal readings in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo PCI, a higher dose is given and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox in case of a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift from GPI - was as effective in preventing new incidents (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients with PCI, Angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as Heparin, except for severe hemorrhages where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the marketing of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST midfielding infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous indication of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is carried out in another row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose can be reduced from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a stub of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an all-certain Bolus-administration of Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second position of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medication should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the dose is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose of a bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second tightening dose must be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bivalirudin-Bolus was administered without dose adjustment with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with anoxox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the completion of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of haemostasesystems and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored for symptoms and signs of bleeding during treatment, especially if Bivalirudin is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, most of the hemorrhages in arterial points of puncture can occur, patients who undergo a percutaneous Koronary intervention (PCI) can perform bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bivalirudin again reaches the level prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregations) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivaliruines with platelet aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemodynamic parameters are to be checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in terms of the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalidate alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivaliidine group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi standards for severe hemorrhages as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleedings were significantly less common among bivaliruines than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe hemorrhage was defined as one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduction of haemoglobin levels ≥ 4 g / dl with known blood vessel, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasional), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivaliidine group as well as in comparisons treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bivaliruine than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped in accordance with system organ categories in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivalirudin can immediately be canceled and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre as well as in the ion binder region of thromboin, irrespective of whether thromboin is present in the liquid phase or at the clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of Bivalirudin to thromboin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin on its part slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivaliruines with serum from patients in which it had come to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) were not induced to induce thrombocyte aggregation reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is confirmed by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm injected or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not work efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisine is very slightly different from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter active life than a short acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged four to 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body of insulin is unable to work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lucine or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or to apply subcutaneous injection into the abdomen area by continuous infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a disability of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effective strength, the brand (normal, NPH, zinc retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or abortion, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin belonging to another manufacturer should be performed under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dioxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing under the effects of sympathisers such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin secretion enters human breast milk, but in general insulin does not pass into breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the adverse drug lists known from clinical trials (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; often: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, drowsiness, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is neglected to continuously change the injection point within the injection molding area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by a appropriately trained person, or by a doctor by intravenous administration of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous levels of insulin, the action occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin lulisiness in the therapeutic relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportionate glucosescing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisiness has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosency effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was clear from the data that in an application of insulin lulisine 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-randiale glycaemic control is reached like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisine was taken 2 minutes before the meal, better postpranial control than with human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisine is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nudes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisine at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisiness for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human normal-maligned, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
