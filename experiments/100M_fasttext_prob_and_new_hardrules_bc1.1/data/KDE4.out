package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available more easily .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting Add Settings ... Open the Tools menu and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crashing module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if any .
the Module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the top node of the document , for example : docum@@ enta element , all other nodes are sub elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size represents the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap account a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over View color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the sh@@ ading depth or the representation of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles occurs ( whereby the display errors occur due to restrictions on the character of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework will require space that is no longer available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames , so that rect@@ angles occur , which are as square as possible . the best methods are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can design@@ ate the minimal displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for use with K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , allowing you to set the appearance of the gallery .
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Pictures per line has a sli@@ der and a rotation panel to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each row in the gallery .
the file name of the image shows whether the file names are displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
the file size of the image shows whether the file size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
the image size check box shows whether the image size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , select where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders to be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where to store the HTML page .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set a sli@@ der or turn field to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
with the check box original images , you can specify whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
use the comment text box to use a comment for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails as in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can download . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; K@@ DE , programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all required information is entered here already . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions about other users . however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information on &amp; digi@@ cam ; learn .
the best start to get on &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to announce in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
when you first start , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder here . simply enter a path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data log is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ cam ; views each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; En@@ tries recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders . this can be done extra &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List have no photos as symbols . you can change those by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favor@@ ites to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ cam ; may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help raw camera support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can download . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the g@@ photo@@ 2 program for communication with digital camera . g@@ Phot@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and are slow over the serial port , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ View@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read digi@@ BO@@ s thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ View@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not work or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ cam ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to develop K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ ot@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; edited ; by writing a small module to add a function when the modifications in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even carry out .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ Struc@@ ture , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that you can not drop a picture in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to print the most common folders : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Configuration dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that have been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where the album was created first , and the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Add Album Import pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
in order to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can drag the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the menu that appears , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right @-@ click on the album and select the album properties contex@@ tual menu .
album Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . select the collection from the toolbar or select Albums Up collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with View Albums Up Date .
the buttons El@@ der , average , new test@@ ers : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; open , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and in the contex@@ tual menu &amp; quot ; As album preview click ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the area My key@@ wor@@ d@@ list at the bottom of the main window . album collections always have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this by using Tools to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . which information is this , you can edit settings ; set up the albums page and customize the pane thumb@@ nails to suit your needs .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the Intro@@ duction section in the main window displays such an help window .
photos are all you need to edit . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that are with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by pressing either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit ... Edit ... in the Edit section , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ cam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub @-@ menu . to do so , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing through other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata presented in the image . some programs do not save this data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the preview and select the rotation . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ cam ; delete it , it is moved to the garbage bin@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del In case you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ders ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select dates or weeks in the date leaf at the bottom of the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or searching .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords il@@ lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ d@@ press , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can therefore also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the key words when losing the database re @-@ imported once &amp; digi@@ cam ; the pictures notice .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either &amp; quot ; My keywords ; or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword . if you click on an existing keyword , it becomes the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select as the album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select the keyword from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you choose one of the keywords you have assigned to him . this way you can select a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the right @-@ click context menu and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
a select frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all the corresponding images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection , which will appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
ne@@ bul@@ a search box is a small lamp that gets green if the search finds matches . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp turns red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . after you have saved it , it appears filter in the list .
if you are happy with your selection , hit the head OK and search will be performed . the search result will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection again , select the corresponding entry from the My Search list and select an option from the context menu .
if you choose to edit Search , the search appears again with the search information previously entered . if you select Exp@@ anded Search , the dialog for Advanced search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete Search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ pe@@ ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group or deleted from it . each option can be linked to others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create Search of Type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they conform . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar . by using a swing , the selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the right pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini programme . you can zoom in or out using the mouse wheel . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To add the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the be@@ acon and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window , you can quickly open the lighting table with L Tools .
from the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen .
another mode is better suited for quick sorting out of a picture series . if you use pairs of images from the toolbar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal soldering actions also work directly from the lighting table like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swivel the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will display the same image area in the preview mode .
the zoom works just as in other views . simply use the zoom sli@@ der under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image was taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digital photos holds a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , find , protect and use photos again . we focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing , optimizing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ is@@ cated and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to save the metadata in both a database and the image files guarantees a very fast search and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
the rest of the photos will be organized in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files are compatible ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the Save Metad@@ ata option in the Edit Settings page ; to enable EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data to be written to the file . if you forget it , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; they have a metadata editor available for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at the next work .
let us now continue with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs or categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalog @-@ ized images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ cam ; automatically create the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . converting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by moving a sub@@ tree to another . the changed key words are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical time span is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the let@@ tering has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a label . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation already drives with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ k@@ alizing are countless and will be even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually rep@@ licate your journeys using pictures with ge@@ o @-@ data . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove limitations concerning the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . once this value was saved , it should not be changed any more . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this may be like : employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider &apos;s field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the image to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they have no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete them , in the picture embedded metadata , delete or modify them . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the near future , such a module is available for batch processing .
topics : disk failure , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , wi@@ dened super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you can no longer be trusted as a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a reasonably priced program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for Blu @-@ ray disc .
slowly burn the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : floppy disk study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT notice the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are especially read errors and publishing meters . the expected lifetime amounts to between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account a lot , this can cause serious damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware break@@ age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , be sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used on your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small , and they also contain protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models allow them to continue working until the current runs . if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of current problems with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W UPS may be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . at the end , you should always remember to separate all the cables before going on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory in the offer . there@@ with , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about this is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it is rather disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences in the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at present , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle sheet defects on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss for not@@ ebooks and 46 % for work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage than for example th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most popular file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process in case of a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stop settings from fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss . thus , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . backup your data frequently to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous or new installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA disk . if , then one day , a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget Air@@ craft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ aster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said above is a common reason for losing data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made . this backup is closest to a version@@ ing system with the exception that is only sam@@ pled and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
thus valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to for@@ ge a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of stri@@ ser@@ fs if needed
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend to you to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( Def@@ l@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and oblig@@ ates to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block &amp; quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive it before an original image file , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP adapts to it because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were possibly cut off by other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam ; to get . in the Adding a Photos to an album , you will find a description how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when the connection is made , it may take a while . if the connection is established , a fer@@ al indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music etc. are shown on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ cam ; or editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all . this downloads all the photos from their camera into one album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . downloading the photos is not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . as soon as you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the Sel@@ ected download button is gra@@ yed out until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available for download . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam right now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
the list of existing albums , sorted as usual folder , will appear in the My Albums section . then select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you only want to delete some , you have to select them first and then delete selected ones .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully imported into a &amp; edited ; album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera screen , you should do this via the camera menu because this is much faster .
the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames in case you upload photos from different recording galleries to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken to the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the first two apply the data about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S , for example . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in case of capital letters if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name of the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the point of time recording to automatically rotate during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , &amp; digi@@ cam ; use this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . in the section bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must disable this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; edited ; you where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document , meaning a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click , which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; user wishing to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data get into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical classification ( manual ) and last about manual entry of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
the download of the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of the coordinates which are created e.g. from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road@@ maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you as much control over your work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that edit the behavior of &amp; Edit . to access these settings , you must select in the Edit menu Set@@ ting ; set up the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
selecting Action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; Edit ; note if you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the relevant IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the professional description of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as illustrated photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if he is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here since this is the image of another &amp; quot ; vendor enqu@@ ire ; if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained within the image and not only in the Edit menu ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without being lost .
image Edi@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) save in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse @-@ cursor rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; Edit ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ cam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions will be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the lighting table , these settings are not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed pictures . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you are using the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of .@@ pn@@ g files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , as PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TIFF Com@@ pression option , you can comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the image quality of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm is loss@@ less .
even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is developing very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the default response is that all green pixels are the same . if the pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the VGA or A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your pictures which are burned in , because of the inability of your camera to view the top lights , as a penet@@ rating white . the setting colors trigger creates some unusual results , because they show the top lights in various rose tones . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast satur@@ ating like green and red . &amp; digi@@ cam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the yet un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 , but this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; and D@@ rap@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ es @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ rap@@ w . it produces but color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction since it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ cam ; information about how to translate the color information from a color space to the other are thus the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior If an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start .
color Profile Fol@@ der Place the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the shell file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera creator and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , which do not include color mapping or g@@ amma corrections . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface it can &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the Pre@@ views .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes turn on or off the metadata that are displayed at the bottom of the images while viewing .
the camera properties show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in picture display mode . currently , here are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can view &amp; edit the conversation ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ itly by &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you must save the changes using the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ cam ; disable when starting . this will speed up the start process by &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
the setting When you start looking for new photos forces &amp; Edit ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; edited ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you might want to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ box ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit : contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the entry and selection of the entry Display / Edit .
image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting Up Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File Save as .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore menu or button Rest@@ ore picture editing button Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving .
almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting Edit Un@@ do or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit restore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , use the short@@ cut keys , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to remember .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the return button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will get a contex@@ tual menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions will be revers@@ ed or restored in between .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by moving the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in the photo and zoom out by using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can change it in the Edit dialog by &amp; Edit ; Edit the main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sets . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select Export wizard from the File Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ hap@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the rating section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ tation . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the contex@@ tual menu .
the evaluation is written in the ur@@ gency IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view displays a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the keywords applied before ; session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can easily restrict the number of options in search for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering key words in a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are saved into the keyword keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword Filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop words . suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is reduced to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings Differ@@ ent .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check@@ box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have adapted it mainly &amp; edited ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme is on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to get you the desired result .
if your photo workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
their only other image editions are per email or web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one then use another color space and thus have to worry about color schemes ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to sound my monitor if I have decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must calibr@@ ate your monitor as s@@ RGB means your ; on@@ it@@ or is s@@ RGB . if you are working as s@@ RGB , you either have to calibr@@ ate your monitor to s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting a further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , reconci@@ le , automatic offset and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the light intensity across the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test dot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
similar : this method adju@@ sts the brightness level of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . thus , almost every brightness range has the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces garbage . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
extending contrast : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re @-@ fixing of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ blown images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a little limited by working with 8 bits per color over a colour space . so if you are too far away from the original image areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 bit mode , your possibilities for correction will fail .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Color white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ eness again , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat around with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the White Balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons are exactly the same . each setting of the white balance you have set can save you into a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding needs more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles .
another important tool is to find the color correction file in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously so you can always use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under Col@@ ors gra@@ dation in the menu .
this &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a result of when one replaced a partially developed pressure from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ en and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation Eff@@ ect . the original is the ( 1 ) and it processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ o@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a converted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . with large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo . you can try to preview the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu of colors .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem : too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog with this tool appears very complicated , you only need the area of the slide for the application intended here . the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram are more concrete .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to post@@ p@@ one the controller and to make sure that the image changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the upper for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ ges .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two control kno@@ bs that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later , using the Gim@@ p level format .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you can only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below is an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right :
modi@@ fiable channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most meaningful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a curve part to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright notes correspond to dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the corresponding image pixels .
preview the original photos is a red marker . if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . each curve that you created can be stored in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cam format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you can only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Col@@ ors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and defl@@ ection . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the bottom right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to keep lumin@@ ance , the image will keep the general brightness too . this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me since the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible rus@@ hing coming from the color space . colour space consists of small room arti@@ facts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you can only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since colour images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day time , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and enhances the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ me@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ me@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture in the image .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been used on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological obstacle for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly round the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any position . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
with the &amp; digi@@ blade ; apply tool template you can place a template over a picture .
the Image template menu can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ cam ; sten@@ cil database , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ cam ; mailing list digi@@ cam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using this tool for the first time , you must place your sten@@ cil folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically .
below the preview you will find three buttons that allow you to change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inks : this button decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digital@@ isation process colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn causes blur@@ red edges to be printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for the private user .
for JPEG images a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ness . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers apply a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sharpen@@ ing .
you should be careful with this , since the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ tly mark with the menu entry Cho@@ col@@ ate sof@@ tness and experiment a bit with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Non @-@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red picture that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . this allows for a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between tones are excluded and therefore beauty f@@ laws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example for the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focusing an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted design @-@ filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focuss@@ ing usually reaches better results than fu@@ zzy mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re @-@ focus in image processing .
in practice , the circular fold is much better than the Gau@@ ß @-@ F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the swelling spots , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß @-@ F@@ altung is very strongly influenced by the remote pixels , causing undesi@@ rable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular fold . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation decreases the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further mi@@ tig@@ ate the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is statisti@@ cally caused . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase of the die size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circle @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but later left unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , blur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this might be caused by the blur@@ ring mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it is impossible to remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . in practice , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the knob bl@@ ends the blur@@ ring of the area that is dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink provides a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ ima project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use tab and Advanced Settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a movie grain or CCD Space , a high value is generated wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smooth@@ es &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing effect over all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ step width as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles generate a long runtime . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value of less 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor , but it doubles the running time . therefore , we recommend it to skip it .
the buttons Save as and Load exactly do this . correc@@ ting any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
the module is used in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is an odd black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor movie storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and Rau@@ schen or Schmi@@ ere occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks may occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark@@ er areas , which are typically more strongly smo@@ ked .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be saved to the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cho@@ col@@ ate sof@@ tness and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove gau@@ ze &apos;s h@@ iss , film bas@@ kets , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local faults that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ ima project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting is intended to correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and Load exactly do this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time using the button Be@@ ading .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts created by the scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
this &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels &amp; quot ; bright pixel quot ; and quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark@@ er . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels .
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , applied from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , in particular those in the medium and large photo format , cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area equally . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tis@@ ation ot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by motion .
with the wide exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ aments and the gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without these filters . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction turns the transformation using a Center@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the highest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random a light intensity of 2 , reduce the density to a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions .
the coefficient of the second degree conduc@@ ts the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar ro@@ unding effect but flat on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth grade fixes the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be virtually eliminated .
general : this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree . with negative values , distortion @-@ like distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter &apos; general .
zoom : this value res@@ sc@@ aled the image size , resulting in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the Pre@@ view dialog illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ ing or kis@@ sing correction should be performed before any trimm@@ ing or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction , the effect would seem evi@@ dently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . then move the mouse cursor in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards you can correct the sound / kis@@ sing distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ formations trimm@@ ing from image editing or via the zoom sli@@ der of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as photographs from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . be aware that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gra@@ dation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Option Add movie grains if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator alters the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter bl@@ ends color channels for reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
this is from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the effect of the film gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to check the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and still lif@@ es are good for this effect .
there are two control kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suitable for large pictures .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the lines that outline the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sket@@ ch out yourself . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two control kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob adju@@ sts the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Be@@ ading .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image along star shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ry the image by turning the pixels around a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ ot@@ gun : blur@@ ry the image due to accidental shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
smart blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the image and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the picture into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Be@@ ading .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it a wet appearance to your images . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows changing the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops in the picture .
you can hold with &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing a range of free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain uncovered . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be found in the Trans@@ form Rot@@ ate menu or Trans@@ form Swit@@ ches menu .
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of picture quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm which is used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the size tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , try to blow the tool .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo bla@@ ster was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ ima project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge any st@@ all@@ ying for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
the cro@@ pping of a photo is not only a frequently used operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you simply need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries File Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut picture .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be retained .
when cutting to the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width are always assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
when you use the editing tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help make it possible to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonious tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf@@ lets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed their temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center .
the golden center provides liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . there should be something that distra@@ cts the eye in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirr@@ oring and vertical mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonic content .
with the button Color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo then it &apos;s easy that you do not hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose Trans@@ form Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right corner .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ form cro@@ pping from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is to cut the function Automati@@ cally . choose one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the turn . however , note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the center of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new Wid@@ th : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle at the top left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the upper right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you will get tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with trans@@ formations from the image processing .
the sh@@ earing tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
pr@@ une your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ earing , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two notes generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ earing the picture has un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove it is to cut the picture with the transformation of the image from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , of the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ cam .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below them .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; show only files in formats to the ones . this is done by means of file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can change this list of file extensions ; you can change this list of file extensions ; you can find more information in the Configuration section .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . this reduces redundant information in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the Configuration section you will find more information about how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ cam ; this is supported by more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be viewed below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are edited by &amp; digi@@ cam ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short movies . this clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; does not include film editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view movies or edit . when you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; s &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start the program for playback .

many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; edited ; your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; use a uniform type of dialog which indicates the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you will see &amp; quot ; texture applicable quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right one shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontally dividing without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
split vertically . the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizontally . the upper area shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general introduc@@ tory page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and drop it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Charac@@ ter@@ istics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini programme . you can zoom in or out using the mouse wheel . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette window , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or browse the folders according to files .
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor back . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated by the Color button , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected , you can set this mode by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the selection of colors can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are based on the program authors ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; c@@ Graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; c@@ Graph@@ vi@@ z ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; c@@ Graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the graph ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zoom is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change .
if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new or c@@ Graph@@ viewer ; or if you want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to divide the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Download page gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( rel@@ o@@ ad automatically or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time you are asked .
the session administration page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v . you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directed graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ rounded graph@@ ene . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring @-@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ c multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ rounded graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ c@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format .
determines the type of the graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ fied ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ rounded graphs ) .
if this option is checked , the overview is shown , if necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows what is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI element with this mouse poin@@ ter to get further help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; c@@ Graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tools for displaying . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid net , in which you draw the symbol .
when the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to start anew from scratch .
if you haven &apos;t made any step und@@ o , this function is disabled .
inserts the clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey scales . this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the symbol range of &amp; k@@ de ;
does not change the symbol but sets the current character color to the color of the point you click on .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
inserts the clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol gri@@ lle .
with the buttons adding ... , Edit ... and R@@ emo@@ ving you can change the templates for standard file , source file , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc ; .
select Transpar@@ ent pixels or display rulers and set up one colored : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparent display . you can also adjust the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : choose the kar@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and Color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module read images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the File Scan menu , a dialog appears which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ oth own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . read more about the estimated file size in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual .
make sure that the window is displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed .
after pressing the Scan button , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
screen@@ shots can be created after you have selected the Import &gt; Screen shot in the Import &gt; Screen . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have picked the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog window appears with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar does not currently have any documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
this module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . likewise , the Aut@@ op@@ lay option is available for the Windows platforms .
K@@ IP@@ I modules extend the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and other capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you like within the calling program .

when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is practically your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s website . the following page will be presented to you following a successful login .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog showing the current access permissions that the module displays . currently , you do not need any other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button Add photo should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts .
the keyword field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as key during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading . the size is taken from the value registered with Maximum Size .
the Maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic location module provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears then . to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same time in the same places as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation , which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation from below the data is merged , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have a track data from a place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have matching data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates from one call to the next you just have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . select the respective region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tabs are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab App@@ ear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; D@@ exter@@ ity Show
the tab record defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth , which of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the tab preview images allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occur during creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation , zoom or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a full screen image is displayed by default . this can be changed to a win@@ dow@@ ed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
this module allows for the actions below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information takes place .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Client module is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the Metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied by clicking the OK button .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the Pack@@ ages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a base image transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for your DVD player . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the pictures you want to pack into the MPEG slide show . after that you can launch the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio section . you can also change the sorting of images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to reproduce the file on a TV , you need to choose the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds an image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the mp@@ g as possible as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie using the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings at the bottom .
the Print Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful e.g. to improve you or print out with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your RAW files into one of three formats of JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from it is : expect d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance should be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , retains all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your pictures frequently or you may later use them otherwise , you should not select the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality wor@@ sens . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at a time . use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you selected . by clicking the Add Images button you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview on the right @-@ hand side will be displayed .
you can also drag pictures onto the image list and drop them there to add the list of images to be sent .
remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails to send . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in image file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation sel@@ ects very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the Show file name option ensures that the file name of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually termin@@ ate it with Es@@ c .
the Option Pictures random@@ ly select the images displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , every transition between the pictures sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through these , see image . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now in each group , thus in people , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
if you hit People with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few individual images .
if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save a thumb@@ nail image , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to view images in addition to the names , select the button located on the right of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must choose which image to display for each individual . to do this , you must select the image view window ( described in detail ) and select the image for the respective person . in the View window you can customize the image for the respective person . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search function in the main window , you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for determining the image properties . you can view this dialog once again .
if you want to enter a string in the label or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you would like , you can also enter a date after which you want to be searched ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images according to specific names , as you can see in the picture .
this is the User Manual for &amp; Photo Album ; if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but rather want to try similar features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; Photo Album ; and watch the Quick Start , screen@@ shots and introduction videos .
start &amp; Photo Album ; and in the first dialog select the demo if you start &amp; Photo Album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample pictures will be loaded and you can check out the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays date statistics on the images in your database .
each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries previ@@ ewed from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be shown in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will be able to cancel the selection by clicking on a bar on the tim@@ eline .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create through the menu File html ... .
before HTML pages are created you need to set some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first enter the title of the overview and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file that is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer . for example , that all images are of a party . note that all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not addressed in particular .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 have no more images , which for example have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . thus , it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . if he wants to get a bigger picture , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best , choose a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them to it . to enable the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have changed all three to base folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in these settings , the name of which you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time for it , you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not go once again .
with &amp; Photo Album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external ones . they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images to the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it scans the images found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can invo@@ ke through the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is supposed to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . you will have the following three choices :
if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copy to .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying , for example , that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import pictures are to be copied .
it may be that you will person@@ alize the category of people of the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialogue window , you will be asked what categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups . for example , if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Design@@ ating information on your images , through ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images , but it has been extended and today your videos are also taken care of . in many places in this manual you talk about images , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want them .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are stored and will automatically re@@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start a different folder tree with images , you can use the -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
go to a window with which you can modify the settings of &amp; Photo Album ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained .
on the left you can see six different icons , which allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , such as people , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
you can view the dialog used to process already existing groups . you can select a label and a symbol for each existing group .
in the Options section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list box above you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself .
because the modules of several applications are used together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should first test new modules using the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category persons , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so whether you would have selected persons to view and pass on to the module .
since some modules are not compatible with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; Photo Album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to any other K@@ DE application , see the menu and toolbar at the top . below the toolbar , you will see the window that you can browse through your image database . in the section , we will return to that window , but now click on the image that shows you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons on the picture , where the image has been recorded etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images simultaneously . if , for example , on all pictures , Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these comments can be used for browsing and browsing as described in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
here you can see three lists with a text box by setting up people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always be using them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images inside the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown on all 50 pictures , you can , by moving the names used up , find and classi@@ fy people more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol on the list .
if you have selected any comments for each image individually , you may still want to edit all selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . simply click on the front and back buttons below to preview the image .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an over @-@ group . to show you that it is an over @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and place it there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . note , this requires you to sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the Comment dialog by clicking and dra@@ gging the paste that forms the top edge of the box . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside of the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a box . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options button ... and then window / hide this window . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or of all images if you do not set filters . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as wallpaper for your desktop .
once you click on an image , it will appear in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview screen . simply select the respective images you want to delete and either click the Remove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures anywhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the pictures anywhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; Photo Album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images on which the upper right corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . if you want to avoid h@@ ass@@ le , how to avoid the confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images .
in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end ones you want to make accessible to others , click on the current view and lock the menu entry All except current view .
thus you have set which pictures should be hidden in case of the case . if you give the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , whereby all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on the lock .
it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the Privacy menu .
on the one hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml may read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d looking at private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . these can be started from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he naturally shows the picture , but additional information you have entered through the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box is on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer you can drag in and out in the image . to zoom in , you can zoom in with the mouse . with the minus button you can zoom out the zo@@ om@@ t Plus key again in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . using the DC key sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the turning functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work for videos . you can make ann@@ ot@@ ations to the current image with the menu item Notes from the context menu .
when you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can cancel the look and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you might prefer to just highlight the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with characteristics as you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in view a picture in which the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have added features to your images , these are available in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you choose , you simply have to use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview pane . if you can view categories in the preview pane , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow you to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database .
in order to stop painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the image from the context menu . to end the painting just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; work , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Add menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to choose the correct position :
delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply and disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
click on thumb@@ nail in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . by default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check out locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag them with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene selected in the toolbar .
the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window ordering or if you need a different configuration , you can adjust it arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle will show the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card tabs at the top in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are pending views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginner to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing left in the beginner bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the beginner bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position .
the current window view can be saved with the View window . a dialog will appear where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 is currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Mode menu , select the following dialog :
each render mode has a name . you can type any name , but it makes sense , however , a name that lets you know the features of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image detail to render into the input fields .
in the quality drop down sel@@ ector you can select the properties that are used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the second method is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is divided up and down again and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the default threshold , then both pixels will be calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are tra@@ cked separately and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to let a scene be calculated with this property .
on this card you can indicate whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly completed , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray scene , select Import Remove File ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command @-@ range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your retention and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a better wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high detailed fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections . this property results in better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you tick the wall , a wall is rendered back behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you tick the ground , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you tick channel smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Pan@@ e Reg@@ ulations you will be explained how to create and store window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector Standard window ordering : displays all existing window configurations . and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window ordering at the start of the program .
the Exist@@ ing window orders list shows all existing window orders . a new order can be created by the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the button Del@@ ete .
each order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created by the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the button Del@@ ete .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating en@@ capsul@@ ates the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window ordering :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
to follow this guide , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . thus you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the Apply button or enter the input key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a fa@@ der ( inser@@ ting infinite body boxes ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited final level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can un@@ fold the item for the floor by clicking on the + before the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should shift the floor to practice one unit below the horizon line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but in the moment you select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please choose first sub@@ object . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matte black material , because you still have to enter the pigment settings . so please always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you do not see color on boxes and balls in the preview , click Apply first and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select each time mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to carry out this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input key or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor , since you have shifted the floor around one unit down .
of course rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , place a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the sphere a pigment as color :
select First Sub@@ jects and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the brightness effects and reflection already have some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the rendering hypo@@ the@@ tically shoots from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect . so the scene is processed pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
restore the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can select this menu item only if you still have not saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last ann@@ ot@@ ated command . you can select this menu entry only if you have used Edit Un@@ do .
saves the current window ordering and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
a dump @-@ map is a possibility to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic objects are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic objects . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view using the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s or the Return key .
you can indicate whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a particular file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Configuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of these , General and editing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .

&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over your work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ shot ; to access these settings , you need to select the behavior of &amp; show@@ shot ; select the settings dialog in eight pages . you can change between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . the same page bar can also be found in image editing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ el@@ ites ; is an application to scan images that do no more than scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ el@@ ites ; is a simple application for scanning images that do no more than scan and save images . &amp; Chann@@ els ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; using the command channel @-@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ites ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan for the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will be shown in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a break and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the same name dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not requested by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save images . open dialog to store for each image opens the dialog in front of each scanned image . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the option Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by using the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is automatically counted each time an image is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the knob help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button over starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other keyboard short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking into the player window and selecting the Global keyboard short@@ cut by right @-@ clicking into the player window and setting short commands ... Select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all needed modules are present and use k@@ Dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with D@@ CO@@ P your script can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands to run . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Soft the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece queries ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files in the playlist , if a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; finished , or when the user stops a script , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. cleaning operations . this includes storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be zi@@ pped with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with an extension amar@@ ol@@ script . for this reason , you should immediately ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can rel@@ o@@ ad it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just look for a quite certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is smart , sexy and chic - just the right way to re @-@ experience your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok source to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto conf and autom@@ ake are used , you shouldn &apos;t have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . see the System Requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar ; the option switches the experimental function of the tun@@ er bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this will change the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
lay mood files in music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , automatically saves the current playlist to the finish of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep track of the current piece in order to keep the playlist window rolled up / down to keep the current piece in the visible area of the window .
switching to context @-@ browser changes automatically the context browser as soon as the next play is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting tagged fonts , the otherwise gray presented section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the drop @-@ down dialog .
with the Sel@@ ection Custom color scheme you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated including the color selection for foreground and background color .
resume playback at the start causing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the color selection dialog .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below is a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the option Screen is designed for X@@ in@@ ama users , allowing you to specify on which screen a multiple monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio output card card lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate other settings in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok , to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to music .
monitor changes : enable &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setting .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l Setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under Calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , enter the port : the network port under which the database is reachable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the card@@ boards last@@ .@@ f@@ m al@@ ig@@ ns the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile here . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
get a similar performer : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok , a list of similar interpre@@ ters will be retri@@ eved to the played piece . you can view the list in context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to build k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ at@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the times , this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of the used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the Met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this can be fixed in the Control Center under App@@ ear@@ ance Symbols . note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : cat@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : cat@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this using ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any existing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . they can also help with other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only an empty playlist . how do music pieces get there now ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to control the user interface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from Play@@ list Remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it down exactly as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you will find the Play@@ list button . click on it .
you probably lack the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config program . install x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( through the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be : what kind of media types does G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are included ( due to patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Extension Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously audio . this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might need to provide another sin@@ king ( e.g. , os@@ s@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . activate Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ am@@ ers react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ab . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . follow the register @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the m@@ peg @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report about this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks when you are on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running part : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user id user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace the IP address with your IP and your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .

the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , do not deter from the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
in the navigation pane , you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as context @-@ browser . on the right , you find the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet powerful enough even for advanced users .
the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub @-@ windows will be explained later in detail . they provide information about the current piece to different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub @-@ window has dropped off . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Tools statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation .
the images may have arbitrary names , but images with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images embedded either with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the pieces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ ded pieces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this area displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will pop up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok will attempt to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running yet , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to artist and below will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / year - Album - Sor@@ ted according to artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist - their pieces are first sorted by genre and among them according to artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album under the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing as desired .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you have something to change to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located right under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which help you can filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year . furthermore , you can also choose your entire collection , whereby the filter is practically disabled .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set the pieces in queue mode - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - S@@ aves the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details .
all pieces of this interpreter will burn / burn to CD - therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the garbage bin@@ s ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
set up selection mark - Change a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that , the album will not be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes handling many play@@ lists easy . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
also , smart play@@ lists created by yourself are possible . click on Add Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ windows will be used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click Apply .
the search function is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all the files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . for example , enter / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press enter key , you can access music in the music file Musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of the Shift key can be difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : thus dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all the entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you would like to search for entries containing white spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries found by Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you would like to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bathroom .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key and then right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow und@@ o and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar you find a unique , magni@@ fier analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons ... Select .

with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select :
after you have set a piece into the queue , a number next to the title appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .

this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is meant for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the media , it only fa@@ des the previously imported files .
this also allows you to create only a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of copy dialog is not yet supported , therefore the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even possibilities to change the size and cut black margins .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the mapping assignments .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , through a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the contribut@@ ors will give you the default .
in this chapter we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other features to create new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f curr@@ ent@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ .d@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string name , Q@@ string ) ) void add@@ 1@@ Item ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT address / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is an audio CD ; - reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , easily audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data enco@@ ded in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that encoding these WAV files ( los@@ sy compression ) by default ( This enco@@ ders packages need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats like loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all of these programs are generally not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ dic@@ er gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device avoids protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection .
while setting up should only be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . step by step , you will find more information about how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
CD@@ DB starts the CD@@ DB request according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must be established first . )
start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . it must be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as logs , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with various flash@@ cards ( such as encoder , to set up the encoder ) . you must go here before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly any commercially available commercial devices that can play these files .
O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( high bit rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices exists .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression ratio up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex pieces of music and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , shared stereo , compression ratio about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car ster@@ oids . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio creator must be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the Assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being har@@ med by the CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; actively select a check box . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the one in the system . in this way of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has verified the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the nearest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for online access from &amp; CD ; information during read @-@ out on &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this has not been done yet .
to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ye c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the encoder package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ye c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; do not want to read the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key words ( tags ) .
both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , for example , as it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setting up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes how to read &amp; record a CD ; what needs to be repeated for each CD ;
here we define the enco@@ ders to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( .@@ mp3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to load the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any read@@ out of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM drives and / or DVD drives will help .
the map menu General Settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
just select in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card @-@ card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you later are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resul@@ tant directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory or file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first one .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as it is shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls install the 88@@ 80 protocol as standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . to disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take over the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously dischar@@ ging pieces : sorry , there &apos;s one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this to the CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . do not forget that folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as shown on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extrem@@ ely &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each read@@ out of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change them again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section , since we are comfortable and the CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process described in this section must be repeated for each release &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
since we use a CD which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data collected from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done yet , the CD now has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look at the Questions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces have already been filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry that best fits your opinion to your &amp; CD ; .
if you did not select the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger by choosing the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - entry of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment field of the album can be used for individual comments , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot below . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist &apos;s and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment section . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all encoding and file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD ; in this example , this is not important since we do not send the CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second one .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first part . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title dates of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece into or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All Remove button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when clicking on the Select button to start reading the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the jobs and track what is going on .
on the tab , click on orders to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the bottom left part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error when trying to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first part .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows to read and code in parallel . notice the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of though two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; some of an important package . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is intended for people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help such as the program can be adjusted to your needs once it runs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still to read ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the start of the program , without any reference point as it should continue from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? if you read this , you probably have already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least only after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with that suggestion .
strange , if you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it features real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound Project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window on k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( such as song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
session support . when you end up playing a song while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also create a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the Play button from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once you play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and passing it back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right of the tempo ad and adjust the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure affects the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically retri@@ eved , which uses a song , so that you do not have to manually set the text selection . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to specify an event type , select the items of text or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played in series . this section shows how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the collection menu under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking Copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when ex@@ iting the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it has to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the Automatic Add to Collection option .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add @-@ in to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the pop @-@ up sequence of the menu selection menus , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it from the Collection Manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song back , select the For@@ mer piece , the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates General @-@ MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which transforms all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet when a piano should originally play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ us cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this topic describes how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun signal . add the following to the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( a gun ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) will play 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards own it ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to depic@@ t sounds on the percussion channel . take a look as an example of the included key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and the second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will need to be defined further forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on that channel . in this case , always use Patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard that gets a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , is supposed to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog .
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played notes . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point Channel View : settings
the pace LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can result in very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
first , check Automati@@ cally add to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default pace , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have open a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) merely in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you just want to listen to a file fast without adding it to a collection , turn off the Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then you decide to play B@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards to me . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to write to &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ se@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ ac@@ ea , but I try to take a bit of time . as a hobby I have to program , collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an expansion of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great joy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or MIDI file , I will contact my friends by &amp; k@@ mid . if you send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file .
I wrote &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to stress that I only want to continue programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ us support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , bug notification or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course I would like to thank all these excellent musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , it can be found on its homepage which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with further kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends significantly on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile it with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then works as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if any problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ MB ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ do@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections in the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Continu@@ ous Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , select from the menu View and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist from the Edit menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to enable other animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Players / DATA@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / DATA@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during starting does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool bar of S@@ MB . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; all needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how to play &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialogue file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or S@@ MB Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output inside &amp; S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to always take a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player is the dialogue in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ d in it .
since the V@@ DR support for S@@ MB only supports X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , S@@ MB uses various names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation this is dv@@ d@@ NA@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ sp@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ers , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , and v@@ dr@@ . when they are enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any clu@@ es how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as root after mounting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts up slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be tested for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

new users don &apos;t need to worry . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; it is likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you have noticed it by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will be spar@@ ed by high@@ lighting time and more .
with the automatic completion of the surroundings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin } from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the closing of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu Set@@ ting ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ section the bottom element ) :
in view of the document in the Struc@@ ture view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very useful when trying to build your own . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ a@@ edi@@ agnos@@ tic file &#93; has been created , &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button on the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the spring search , the elements of the DVI ; file are drawn with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked into the DVI ; file , the corresponding section in the / latex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding section in the DVI ; the source text is j@@ umped at the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings .
quick mounting : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; monitoring : in this mode the DVI ; file is opened on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick build . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when looking at the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for fast structuring of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available and latex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes or references . the possible possibilities are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , a picture , or a different element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( select a select field ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can of course also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; manually written .
the last drop down box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ z@@ e is used for the definition of the font . it enables the font sizes to be set for the main text , the notes , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the quick build button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
if you fail to compile the document , you should search for errors in logging . if you use Quick Start &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the text e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } then allows the alteration of the fonts within the environment . &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ling . &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
changes are carried out only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for passive pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be itali@@ ci@@ zed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ share : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . this should be a quotation , a few places in bold and ital@@ ics and a poem to apply to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl E can return to the editor ( for internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can start using the buttons in the toolbar .
the search query allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern under Settings box must be set up ... Tools building can be selected .
to search for the prefer@@ ential search , the mouse @-@ cursor has to be positioned in one line of the source text and cli@@ cked on . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then made .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button on the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; P@@ ut document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . for this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ule ; set as text editor ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error in using the &amp; DVI viewer , an error can be found . if there is an error , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window in summary .
the logging file er@@ ases the error source in the source code . in the editor , the heads of La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ d@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for spr@@ ints between the errors . to view the faulty row , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty row .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section .
u@@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file is created .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings boxes ... Settings can be set in General .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by the entry in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { Ex@@ article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones .
a template can be created from any and latex ; -@@ files . if a simple way is used to create a template , search for a template on the Internet and follow the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; c@@ ate ; can be done in menu Tools directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference that can be called over the menu La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use and their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that in this way , clicking \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip is just \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
using the arrow keys with the Shift key pressed , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight the different types of source code . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jumps within the text . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items Edit jump @-@ marks or the corresponding button root allow the jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark . this is also highlighted with this jump @-@ mark , so that it is automatically applied when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; Even though &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities offers , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code is added ; and therefore support &amp; kick ; special commands for their selection .
this extended meaning is meant to include tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only prev@@ ent@@ able thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command is also &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a click swa@@ b ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) to the end .
to delete a part of the document , natural this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; C@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit Select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit surroundings for a more simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment .
if the cursor is in front of or within the \ \ begin { ambient } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command completes the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups defined by bra@@ ces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from Edit surroundings .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the closing clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the sof@@ tened clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted cur@@ ly groups bra@@ ces can quickly get lost . this command completes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple instructions are used as bed@@ side keys . for the beneficial implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used for two simple suit symbols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic entry of the double quotes can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
specific settings ( e.g. n@@ esian or French ) can also be used to make German or French quotation marks . many other languages can also be used .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
in a table environment , close &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; tries &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the next row .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been expanded in &amp; Ki@@ le ; to accommodate special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . three of these modes are implemented for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings boxes ... to be adjusted .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { Environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and possible , thus the complete list of letters is displayed . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , by &amp; Ki@@ le ; ho@@ ck marks may also be added , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by editing ho@@ ck marks N@@ Ã ¤ ho@@ ste jump @-@ mark and then the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... boxes ; you can make adjustments to these lists . there can be different wi@@ per lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher of the general language used .
the command mode is not necessary for completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of completion mode will result in a large list with environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the completion mode over menu item Alt + Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment completion can be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the input key will be terminated .
after this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; real@@ ises that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is included .
under Settings ... boxes ; set up ... boxes ; customize settings to these lists . this mode uses the wi@@ per list of the completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which can immediately be replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... boxes can be set up . as an example of a check list the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode introduced over the menu item C@@ trl + Alt key key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written schemes .
this mode can be set up in the menu Set@@ ting Ki@@ le ... boxes can be disabled . here , the threshold value for the display of completion can also be specified .
the completed files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ ste / complete / mode / the local home folder . mode is available for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog box designs the insertion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ Tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu Cre@@ ating comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer using Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open up each time .
a new project will be asked about the Project New Project .... In this case , the following information is requested for the project :
when selecting the file name , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite clear system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . included is a documentation for the packages included and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database of all documents and boxes ; supplied documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space key opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source editor , available on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working space environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .
many thanks to those who are looking for the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license .

&amp; K@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; c ; . with the command @-@ line interface , you generate random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . due to many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig , read out . for each day , use different signatures , as with random signatures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you an an@@ lt ; empty signature ; and paste your new signature in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . if you have entered your signature , save it by C@@ trl ; S File Save or click the Save Disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Remove or click on the icon with the red cross in the toolbar .
open the Quick command dialog . here you can select short@@ cuts for menu entries . to change a short@@ cut , select an action from the list . then click the User defined button at the bottom right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for use of cookies ; &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all stack elements are listed here . the older the pile entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below .
by clicking on a call stack in the shown list , the cursor will be moved to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file in the main window .

clicking on a step @-@ by @-@ step display in the menu displays a dialog for the selection of the exp@@ ir@@ ation speed .
to stop the process , press the W button or select step @-@ by @-@ step in the menu .
to view a system ID in the current &amp; XML file , select System ID ... in the menu and enter the value to be searched in the displayed dialog .
to post a Publi@@ c@@ ID , select Publi@@ c@@ ID ... from the menu and enter the value to be searched in the dialog displayed .
if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ging stage manager ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the tab &quot; Source Code &quot; in the appearing dialog .
all &amp; X@@ S@@ LT ; source files that are bound by the &amp; X@@ S@@ LT ; file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
clicking on a source entry in the shown list will move the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the beginning of the corresponding file .
if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ging stage manager ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the tab &quot; Source Code &quot; in the appearing dialog .
all found templates are listed here . note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ S@@ LT apply . therefore , multiple templates with the same matches and mode details can be available .
clicking on a template in the shown list moves the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a tab in the dialog X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g @-@ In@@ spec@@ tor . the following example shows X@@ S@@ LT source code in which a global and a local variable is declared .
by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog box below . if a variable has a particular expression , for example
contains , then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the Print button .
when you click on a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter will be moved to the corresponding line of that file in the main window .
the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ure as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply click the symbol for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the ge@@ mes@@ hed job folder , then let the current working folder be checked . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , anyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply let the current work folder be selected . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then let the current file simply be attached . if not , they delete the tick in current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .
if they only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the well @-@ formed check option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D file specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG verification is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by the other file sel@@ ector .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until somebody uses the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we begin with the Edit Plugins menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage and add new plug @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several persons work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions performed when something is happening in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file in CVS once it is added to the project , etc ;
on the site Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Pre@@ ferences dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
ann@@ ot@@ ations are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
it can be either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the recru@@ ited nick@@ name of the team member is , role plays a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting up Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including auto@@ complete can be changed .
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted in this way as described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted in this way as described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
automatically update the start and finish tag : if enabled , the closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic definition of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding code during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be recovered using the standard button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here is exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly so that in case of a power ou@@ tage or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed in the Editor area or in its own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the standard at the next start is useful when the user interface has passed through changing the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message section serves the control of the possibility to switch the display of warnings by means of non @-@ promp@@ ting .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL and the source view in shared mode . regarding the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be adjusted in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree during editing and how deep during a change in the structure tree can be opened automatically . empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , divided . this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ ON applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in the &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses the load . only @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse charging if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserted .
using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view where the contents of the monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is usually displayed in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requests . this action is fired by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be taken care of .
the object to de@@ bu@@ gger session starts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bug request has started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without providing information about the variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bu@@ gging requirement is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is asked .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next script in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next script in the script , whereby if possible , it will be bl@@ ended in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and proceed to the next as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored parameter appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder enter the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better viewing and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as a single element type about itself nothing else .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for class class . the base class name for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
when yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . in addition , it contains further tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed , etc ; This is a single element type element .
prints the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ained and closed properly .
whit@@ esp@@ ace doesn &apos;t affect anything , but look &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML file , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , with its simple instructions to follow .
currently , this function is not available . currently , the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; Over @-@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D settings . thus di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created a simple descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut keys assigned to this action . by clicking on the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but this is not limited ) that modify the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we sub@@ stituted the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text will be attached to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be specified , which can be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard error output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the given case it is not too many , therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the marker .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ current ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other .
please note that the icon created does not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loos@@ ely , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is added ; start@@ les ; -@@ tag will be inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar and set the toolbar button . make sure the toolbar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all symbols to make sure everything works .
after new@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that its toolbar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding file .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone did that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second one we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation tab of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders on the tree with its own contents . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
whit@@ esp@@ ace doesn &apos;t affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation should be displayed for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of sub@@ merged context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / s / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global usage . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that they are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you won &apos;t be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download it . to make a contribution , we recommend to sign the resources , which requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the Save New Resource , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool toolbar , and begin in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ts Tree context menu .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and marking . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creating a D@@ TE@@ P package can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in everyday XML format . there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination Directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Definition bar : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and to be able to draw full use of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you first have to famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars about actions , everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this allows the group of administrators to backup different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS , patterns to tool bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are laid in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the joint use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the tabs with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all the tabs , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execute CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the editor pane to create a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of the tool bar , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; insert into their document , then click on the symbol representing the tag . if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open them and strip them . in the display with tabs for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation , tree views are available .
project Management is a powerful tool that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages available . the concept of integration into Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can call the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can easily change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the entry system aligned to the contents enables the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development . it is possible to download pre@@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs on the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed specify all error messages ( if any ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand @-@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolute greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop what already someone else has developed ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sm@@ ells is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost any task . by the program com@@ man@@ i , they can be expanded without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any language syntax . ( read more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly evolved into a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers reli@@ ed the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more documentation in details is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list always changes when you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the templates section . should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project default folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and whit@@ esp@@ ace in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script displays error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
starting and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar at the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries preceding or next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files to the server in your project . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or Project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be set using settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are saved by toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removed a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( possibly at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
enables the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; which has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activating or de@@ activating the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; when inser@@ ting by tool bar , this tag does not contradic@@ t the rules .
in the Plugins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed below the menu items listed above . click on them .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes take time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling out the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( eg foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host configuration , an adaptation may be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , etc ; ) you have to proceed in a different way .
if a project is started from scratch , if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this displays a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded to the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the sub@@ windows profiles or changed using the Shift ; F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supplementary option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
upload profiles ( see in ) can be set in the Pro@@ files sub @-@ window , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing your own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . you cannot influence this behavior at present .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the icon project open from the toolbar . the Open Project Open Project will be displayed and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files finds . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives you free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves as well , however the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the files uploaded . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten on programs . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk save option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog box if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read simply , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply swa@@ p the view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings toolbar Project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which you have to do the most . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best stack@@ able via the toolbar . using and adding is different . adding tool bars is treated below in the section Adding tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the icons on it can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , and other actions like toolbar can be removed , which can be specified in the dialog , where indicated which actions should be displayed on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and set settings actions .. set .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates are basically like a usual file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are usually found in template @-@ tree among global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents are written in corresponding sub@@ folders . one makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes working in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in template tree among global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template but the same text area again and again in the documents . you can find everything from a final note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples can be found in template tree among global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve all websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure combined in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template Save As a local template ...
once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File As template Save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged along with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
binary templates are simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files and choose site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , the project folder is backed up , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can provide he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically create with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or link files to them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects .
the template structure in sub@@ windows templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the template table with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as el@@ em@@ ental attributes are hal@@ ved .
if a root folder is set so , it would disable templates in this path , except they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to provide a complete presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates to a folder with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
additionally , you have a context menu ( pointing to it , press right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which are accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ side and a cursor . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ance of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor .
the second mode works just like the first one except that the changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor . by pressing F@@ 9 this mode is already active , the key press moves the active cursor from one window to another , while the position in the document is maintained .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor .
met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click in the list enables the modification of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cursor is possible like in a word processor , moving with arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marking functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ etes with the return key or removed button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , has to be removed every other anchor tag .
some toolbar buttons such as the spread@@ sheet assistant or the list wizard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool to study style sheets . unlike other style sheets programs , searching for certain elements is possible and the style template can be tra@@ cked .
to be able to compile successfully &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries that are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
stop in a template , at a point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode , or@@ phan@@ ed holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path input . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a sty@@ ling file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a Vor@@ age named my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a specified model name will be checked .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the named &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a required holding point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the initial template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; K diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e in the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and mer@@ ging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
this is useful if two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps with comparing and mer@@ ging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; with Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are available in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the opening dialog allows you to manually type file names , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files .
by selecting a folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but a folder for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and placing of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
the Info row of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for this is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . with some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have lines . if the line break is activated , the line is represented on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the wording edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ BE &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons J@@ ump to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , any difference at the same time must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this also creates a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar .
this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing the options , or activating Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in any of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the insert button , you can switch between insertion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merge operation and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ picture upward / C@@ trl @-@ picture downhill ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the clip@@ board to the clip@@ board , you have to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and no manual copying . be careful with this option , because you might over@@ write the clip@@ board contents by mistake .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Def@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not using binary files .
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically during shut@@ down and restored at the next start . ( set up Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width for selection , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c font will be displayed . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed ast@@ er@@ ated . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ f@@ aded colour .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted .
when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection will be copied automatically to the clip@@ board . manual copying to the clip@@ board is no longer necessary .
you can select which line of line you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system you use .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 first tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only store a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; , but then , files with different sizes may look identical in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but this option might be disabled as a white character . during mer@@ ging this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict continues .
( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the mer@@ ging menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge . check for details under documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , the original version is app@@ ended to suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to &amp; K diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart so that the change becomes active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the top setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding a quick reference appears , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different encoding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress up@@ sets of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just exit the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which fits exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used for line comparison . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to provide the user with more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ ) .
$ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you &apos;re experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Def@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line spac@@ ing . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead of sed you can use something other like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for display and mer@@ ging . further operations only alter the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or hidden differences , you may inad@@ vert@@ ently not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes for each object a suggestion for mer@@ ging ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge operation and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify the folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , a small news window informs you about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed .
if the scanning of the folders is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories can be opened and all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open or fold all the folders .
double @-@ clicking a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action can not be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C .
in identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries varies .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire contents are identical . then folders have the same color . for folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ty@@ .The colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the Synchron@@ ization mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchron@@ izes directories . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New File instead of Mer@@ ge ( unsure ) is enabled , then expl@@ ores &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such bugs are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file is executed after the other . it shows skill when the merge succ@@ eeds , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is ok all over .
if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Def@@ 3 will show further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C will be used as the destination in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge mode , B is chosen as destination and A and / or B are used as target when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge operation / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to select only the current entry , select Run action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears indicating the incorrect items . they can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog window will appear with the Browse , Sim@@ ulating and Cancel options .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select the directory merge again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue its work with the next entry .
if you click on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not execute them again in the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge operation is ski@@ pped or not , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set the Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; the default is * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS too . many self @-@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set to folder @-@ specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( refer to info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
for links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is turned off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ solved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are identical . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modified date . please use caution with caution . this option is switched off in default .
enables synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are stored . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered un@@ safe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also be deleted without another backup . this also applies to the normal merge of single files , not only mer@@ ging whole folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge view remains visible during mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can split the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the Current File Mer@@ ge function from the Mer@@ ge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder merge .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : list -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency by means of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes due to the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then always a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit permissions or modification date . therefore , the permissions or the change date differ from the original . ( refer to this option Con@@ fi@@ dence of Size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is currently viewed as a Differ@@ ent Viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Def@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assume that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Def@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ ON mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Def@@ 2 ( now it he@@ els Kom@@ pare ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ NO@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as iden@@ tically ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create a separate file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c is swe@@ eping ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis is conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how you can use K@@ NO@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the last changes in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have trouble comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of this .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current cursor .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current version of the program , after changes to these options , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will be missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines already exist , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , stop them or shift them . this works in both a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and the applications in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a working area as well as on other working areas .
the context menu only depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and Finish . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maxim@@ ise , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes application window to full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ tops .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled together with name , names are marked with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is checked , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2 x N grid , such as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical range , which is very good for representation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini programme in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select Set Sel@@ ection Swit@@ ches ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently it is not possible to change the settings in the dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission to the file , you must login as user root or login to your system administrator .
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package is required to install the K@@ DE package .

this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ b ; be .
&amp; likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; likes ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fier window . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; likes ; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ b ; to display a selected area of the screen in the magni@@ fying window ( select window ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cursor . please note that &amp; k@@ b ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and shift the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key press or the &amp; M@@ b , you can move the selection box .
with this combination you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the bottom right corner is to move .
&amp; likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , paste into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; KB ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( once again load the document in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , zoom , and so on ; .
k@@ not also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen@@ shot . you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; to use a range of screen , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor holds a while in the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury @-@ Syn@@ drome ) and cause pain to any click of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer pain in the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) . however , it may em@@ ulate the dra@@ gging with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , because of the pain associated with your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to clarify : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all the ergonomic tools , the result may be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the motion briefly .
move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can run the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click out a mouse click .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is enabled . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place .
this function is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the General tab . there &apos;s a slide bar Sound Bu@@ ffer , which you set to lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program there .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the level after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should be aware of which areas a mouse click is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse globe .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quickly clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you are using the smart move in this case , this means that you can stop the operation by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . however , you can use the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the toolbar and menu and the titles of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using your m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it as follows : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick at the click of the mouse . the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when smart move the shutter speed begins . later you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but for that it requires some exercise .
to be able to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window Maker must be installed . this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button briefly as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to wor@@ sen the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging can also be done with the mouse .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; mouth ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a program that allows silent users to talk to their computers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sets that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command , which will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the Setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text passages book . you can select often used text passages from the text passages without typing them .
&amp; mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to words .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the bottom white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory @-@ memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you have done k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is app@@ ended to the processor memory . you can select from it sets that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings - mouth ; set up ... open the preferences dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ commu@@ te page and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the voice output , enter the command to enter the language generator . in the drop down field , under the input field , specify the character encoding with which the text is passed on to the voice generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ mu@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications provide a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently under development in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text passages or in the paste for text passages .
with the selection of instant speech the selected text passage is directly spoken and added to the default memory . with the selection from In the input field the selected text passage is entered first only into the input field .
with the second selection field , closing the editing window for text passages , you can determine whether the text pass@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text passages book , the book will be saved . if you choose to reject changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ ges@@ tion page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for wor@@ d@@ ging . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; mouth ; reads &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
you can add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting in the menu bar , in the toolbar or using a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the Alt + key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the default memory .
if this menu item is enabled , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar can be moved by default over the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu item is enabled , a narrow bar in the bottom part of the main window will be displayed with hints about the state of &amp; mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu item is enabled , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is positioned directly under the toolbar by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably haven &apos;t entered the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings - mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system at Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output reads :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation .
to show an example of the command line for the setup of the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ e.@@ The voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ h and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be app@@ ended . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just have to use t@@ kt@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the preferences dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends in detail on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot talk to display text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is saved , which the user can always publish again and again .
note that there is no voice syn@@ thesizer on the computer . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .

before you can use the tool , you need to install and adjust tool life @-@ dispens@@ er . see also
at the first start of kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the box card is displayed in General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; use because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ears for the same printer .
if you click the Spe@@ aker sign in kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr , the card @-@ card speaker will be displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ mu@@ g and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already installed appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
select a spokes@@ man from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a spokes@@ man from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a spokes@@ man from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to push the speaker further down in the list . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to make your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a V@@ oting Type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ops ; almost use . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled , so the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create text jobs and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker installed , you can launch the &amp; k@@ de language pron@@ ounc@@ ement system . click on the General tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) service , and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the mark , will keep K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de .
when kt@@ m@@ gr is terminated , &amp; kt@@ ops ; next , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and t@@ kt@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the control bar when reading , it disappears once the reading is finished .
with the buttons in this series you can start , stop , stop and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for one job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ IP , click the General tab and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check whether &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then select the text that should be read , and select Text to read in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the enlarged text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first , check whether &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then select the text that should be read , and select Text to read in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; which noti@@ fies you about events you specify . you can also read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ys ; read more .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ tify , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
text is processed in filters before it is sent to speech @-@ schedul@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace mis@@ spoken words or short@@ cuts , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent specific short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
News have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg , you can read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you initiate from the card card is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; fli@@ s ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and finished .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
string substitute replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; will be supplied with predefined string substitute filters , which enable the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or by e @-@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
with Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text at &amp; kt@@ f ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the tab card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this displays the list of normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in series from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
if you have found these patterns in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text . case sensitive will not be taken into account when comparing .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the creation column .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , app@@ end the entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is used only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages .
if a value is entered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers have to be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter copying .
the string replace filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box apply the filter if matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . however , if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can refer to it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to compose these expressions ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions find in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . but it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
set the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will suff@@ ice .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker installed on the tab card speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; give a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that the program sends to the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speaker set up on the tab card . with the speaker output filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help during input .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text complies with the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your chat settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box of the filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the script to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
the text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands

none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival pages are not read .
due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able at all . you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is installed and found on the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause error in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing @-@ wa@@ g is spent . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , this may be remedi@@ ed by a string replace filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ops have their own license you can find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; download it . &amp; kt@@ ops ; find the source code from ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ organic .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to rate the supported languages .
the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses a flexible module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to bro@@ aden and expand for the use of any other syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the software development files for the speech @-@ dispens@@ er program .
if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ops ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ accessibility or downloaded the tar@@ ball that is currently created each night , compile and install the program using the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ops , first check if your speech syn@@ thesizer does work with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the tool used to integrate speech @-@ schedul@@ er . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat the sentence or paragraph ( s ) , pause , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is feminine , it will be used automatically by the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; select a spokes@@ man , look in .
if you click Add Spo@@ kes@@ man on the Add @-@ on tab , and in order for a speaker to be inserted into the list or click Edit , the index card speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the setup of the Module for Festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is contained in PAT@@ H , you will only have to enter the festival .
select the encoding for text that will be passed to the festival . for voices , which &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you set the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display this gray , the voice you choose will not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click Apply ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of kt@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after starting the program window will only be visible in the system segment , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr does not run , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the tab card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can proceed from or reverse in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on the OK button , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr becomes the symbol in the system section . then click this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled without support for the respective audio module ; can not load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you chose AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device .
make the speech speed here . 50@@ 5 ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ cm ; % approximately twice the normal speech speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in case of doubt choose Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; handles four types of language records :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . after reading the output of the screen reader , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &apos;re reading a long text on a website , you can come with &amp; mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or issue of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output enters the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are valid for regular text orders only . there are no special actions for messages , al@@ erts and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops , read K@@ No@@ tify messages , start kt@@ mu@@ g and click on noti@@ fications .
select this check box to activate the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add or delete events . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the list of the speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action will be applied which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications into a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All No@@ tices are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the default voice , the festival uses in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limit detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds split text into individual sentences . this allows you to start or stop or stop the first set , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you see the set limit detection filters . at the first start of &amp; frac@@ t@@ ts , a set limit detection filter is set automatically as a default . you can change its settings or add more set @-@ limit detection filters , but beginners will not be advised .
the easiest way to learn how to select the speaker by selecting . turn off the speaker sel@@ ector and enter text for reading . switch on the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection is changed . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then can start faster with reading since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel instructions on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this feature .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit detection filters compare text with a regular expression for set ends and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits . note that the standard set limit detection filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( i.e. notify ) , al@@ erts , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set limit detection filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
you can over@@ write the Spe@@ aker &apos;s settings for the application on the list of boxes . the card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card board spokes@@ man ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the features of a speaker set up . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker out . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired typing properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
here you can choose the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
select this check box if the property has preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker area which best matches the following , click on the default speaker and then click Spe@@ aker , which is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it &apos;s started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is terminated . if the problem is not resolved by this , you may need to install a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; console ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find clu@@ es for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it at festival , but kt@@ mu@@ g doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide , you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card reader device . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ys ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . therefore , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber @-@ tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a set of character c@@ assette filters and now I can go back or forth in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more items are displayed on top of the list , but the order consists of one sentence only . what am I doing wrong ?
you may not filter the punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a set @-@ limit detection filter for these characters instead .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling at &amp; kt@@ ops before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ et@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts during audio output . if your system is also part of it , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; freezes when you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will be read al@@ oud .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of speech speed but is otherwise not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command .
you have &amp; kt@@ ops ; downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime @-@ dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free based on the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . the configure option column configure option shows the configure parameter that causes the creation of the creation .
as default setting is &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ accessibility kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd tim@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before using &amp; kt@@ ops ; first , check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the Syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . help you find the instructions included with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , search for the festival &apos;s first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice @-@ sharing system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phone from German texts . more information can be found under .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folders , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package that you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playing bug fixes is not required , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module will display network settings at the &amp; K contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be fully installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed for installing and configur@@ ing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to kernel version :
the Network Settings module is loaded if the Network Settings option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempt will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose from the list that best meets the distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the setting No @-@ Again , the definition can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will automatically pres@@ et this selection .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you get to the right bottom end of the module by clicking the button . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available , divided into three tabs :
the network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network Inter@@ faces :
the settings displayed in the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... to set up the device in the dialog .
only basic TCP / IP settings are available by default . click the Advanced Settings button and displays the dialog with further options .
in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
with the manual selection , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface on boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . using ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched on as needed . switch on a switched off network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and de@@ activating the interface ...
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will replace this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed , or altered . DNS records can be added to the list by selecting an entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ der or Her@@ under .
by clicking the Add ... from the group machine to the name resolution a DNS server can be added . the Add New Name Server dialog will be displayed .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry from the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then click the Edit button .... You will see the Edit dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list named calcul@@ ator specifies host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list includes some well @-@ known hosts some entries , which &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some specific IPv@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test will replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the alias names .
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Add machine will be displayed .
it can perform one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of the static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , you have to set the following command .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf homepage ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and others are required .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , you will find important information about basic network technology , in the second one will discuss all configuration files of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IPv@@ 6 has never found a large distribution of IP networks . IPv@@ 6 is expected to break through in the near future . therefore , IPv@@ 6 is currently focusing on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in external networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is available or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 1@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own host ) . the default route is needed for IP forwarding .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is a different content in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which moreover offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a band can be used , it has to be integrated by &amp; dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; dat ; re@@ vo@@ ke the tape and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . detects and dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing force on the tape does not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; dat ; the pre@@ ten@@ se , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was incorporated . a corresponding message appears in the status bar . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; dat ; indicated by a change in the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat .
a type of tape must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting in &amp; dat file format . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before you use it . floppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; dat ; with the format of the tape proceed . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save As ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens Settings for Backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item Testing ...
once the scan was started , the dialog window will appear . in this dialog you can check your sel@@ ections once again and change the working folder for the check .
when you confirm the verification settings , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before initi@@ alizing the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can check your sel@@ ections once again and change the working folder for recovery .
when you confirm the recovery settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed under Backup Files , only the files in it will be backed up on the same file system as the folder .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files have not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
is this setting active , transm@@ its &amp; dat ; before the tape is involved , the load is loaded to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , &amp; dat attempts to susp@@ end the thrust of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the release of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ects the tape . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , you try to change the hardware @-@ like block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . whether this setting is active or not , you need to tell &amp; dat ; in any case , you need to tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the machine name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not an incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for system logs . the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue provides experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single log @-@ lines of a log file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will not appear to you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have probably not started with system administrators . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for which normal users usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string . the list of the log rows will now be automatically changed , so that only log rows will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can , of course , also select another entry . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , select the process column in the log file system log , and report to you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of the level indicator .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new lines to be added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you can find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following directory of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and so named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for the control of program start @-@ up when you boot up the system in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries are under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you want to boot when you boot up the system or when switching to another running level . system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something that has to be done with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one that he finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning area :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you come back to fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains an K , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server run @-@ level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ scales or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ tation number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : there is currently no possibility to restore records thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the various working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another running level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired gul@@ f level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or name of an entry , press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard runtime levels , and now the machine is constantly starting new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under running level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary alignment programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are available from the system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run level varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .

the password management card will appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD bin@@ s .
this card only appears if for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected by means of the File System with limited space limitation
the management card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
