<seg id="1">Translate the module website in the & konqueror; Edit menu under Tools Site. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. bablefish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions, without checking the translation first.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can paste text to be translated directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them available more easily.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Setting Add Settings... Open the Tools menu and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package which & konqueror; contains before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crashing module, click in the & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if any.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Module view filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Angle filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the top node of the document, for example: documenta element, all other nodes are sub elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportionally to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size represents the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap account a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the shading depth or the representation of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles occurs (whereby the display errors occur due to restrictions on the character of the treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always complied with. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and this framework will require space that is no longer available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames, so that rectangles occur, which are as square as possible. the best methods are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimal displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of TreeMap widgets developed for use with KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Photo Gallery... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens, allowing you to set the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option Pictures per line has a slider and a rotation panel to set the number of thumbnails of each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">The file name of the image shows whether the file names are displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">The file size of the image shows whether the file size is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">The image size check box shows whether the image size is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, select where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders to be included.</seg>

<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set a slider or turn field to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box original images, you can specify whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Use the comment text box to use a comment for the caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails as in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Tools HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under the Navigation Pane window, or using the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation pane; and drag the music files you want to listen to in media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu item in & konqueror; to change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change your browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that refuse access with browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser detection will be used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in & digicam; albums can download. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & KDE, programs are also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digicam; tries to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all required information is entered here already. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicam; is a project that is supported by a community. i.e., users and developers can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions about other users. however, in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information on & digicam; learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get on & digicam; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to announce in the developer mailing list by & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first start, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder here. simply enter a path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data log is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicam; will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder. & digicam; views each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicam; Entries recursively the library path throughout its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders. this can be done extra & digitized; do this by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList have no photos as symbols. you can change those by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favorites to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, & digicam; may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help raw camera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in & digicam; albums can download. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the gphoto2 program for communication with digital camera. gPhot2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and are slow over the serial port, this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">LibgView2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read digiBOs thumbnails. if the Exif support is not available in libgView2, thumbnails may not work or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digicam; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach a common module structure for & digicam; to develop KPhotoAlbum, Shootmg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & edited; by writing a small module to add a function when the modifications in & digikam; even carry out.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side strips with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the AlbenStructure, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that you can not drop a picture in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to print the most common folders: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenConfiguration dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos that have been edited by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where the album was created first, and the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Add Album Import pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an album from one album to another, you can drag the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the menu that appears, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to right-click on the album and select the album properties contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. select the collection from the toolbar or select Albums Up collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: will be used if you sort your albums by date with View Albums Up Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, average, new testers: these put the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digicam; open, the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and in the contextual menu & quot; As album preview click; select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the area My keywordlist at the bottom of the main window. album collections always have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of these thumbnails with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this by using Tools to recreate all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. which information is this, you can edit settings; set up the albums page and customize the pane thumbnails to suit your needs.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot above in the Introduction section in the main window displays such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all you need to edit. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions that are with & digicam; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by pressing either F4 Picture Editing... or the context menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit... Edit... in the Edit section, you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digicam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub-menu. to do so, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing through other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata presented in the image. some programs do not save this data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the preview and select the rotation. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & digicam; delete it, it is moved to the garbage bins of & kde; moved. F8 Picture Delete or Del In case you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumsliders; organizes your photos using the data. & digitised; use either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select dates or weeks in the date leaf at the bottom of the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or searching.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords illogically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keywordpress, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can therefore also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the key words when losing the database re-imported once & digicam; the pictures notice.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either & quot; My keywords; or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword. if you click on an existing keyword, it becomes the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the image with the right mouse button and select as the album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select the keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you choose one of the keywords you have assigned to him. this way you can select a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the right-click context menu and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">A select frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this displays all the corresponding images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection, which will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">Nebula search box is a small lamp that gets green if the search finds matches. if you click here the filter will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again. if the search did not find anything, then the lamp turns red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion. after you have saved it, it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, hit the head OK and search will be performed. the search result will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection again, select the corresponding entry from the My Search list and select an option from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit Search, the search appears again with the search information previously entered. if you select Expanded Search, the dialog for Advanced search appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "if you want to delete an existing search from the list, select" "" "Delete Search" "" "from the context menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digipe; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database. an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group or deleted from it. each option can be linked to others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... you can create Search of Type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they conform. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar. by using a swing, the selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the right pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Marble mini programme. you can zoom in or out using the mouse wheel. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this requires, of course, that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the beacon and its window opens. if you are back in & digicam; main window, you can quickly open the lighting table with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited for quick sorting out of a picture series. if you use pairs of images from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the comparisons. use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal soldering actions also work directly from the lighting table like e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivelling function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to swivel the visible area of the image, you must click it and hold the & LMB; then both images will display the same image area in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works just as in other views. simply use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image was taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos takes up, scans or digital photos holds a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up, find, protect and use photos again. we focus on downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confiscated and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is based on your definition data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digicam;. the approach to save the metadata in both a database and the image files guarantees a very fast search and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">The rest of the photos will be organized in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files are compatible? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the Save Metadata option in the Edit Settings page; to enable EXIF and IPTC data to be written to the file. if you forget it, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? & digitized; they have a metadata editor available for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, captions and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at the next work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now continue with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call other programs or categories continue. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalog-ized images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicam; automatically create the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. converting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by moving a subtree to another. the changed key words are edited by & digikam; updated while it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, have associations, memories, the historical time span is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the lettering has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation already drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolokalizing are countless and will be even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually replicate your journeys using pictures with geo-data. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove limitations concerning the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digicam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. once this value was saved, it should not be changed any more. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this may be like: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider's field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you offer the image to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they have no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete them, in the picture embedded metadata, delete or modify them. for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitized; in the near future, such a module is available for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, widened superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it's about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled carefully and you can no longer be trusted as a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a reasonably priced program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs on Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark and protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives on this topic: floppy disk study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. some errors identified by SMART notice the imminent failure. these are especially read errors and publishing meters. the expected lifetime amounts to between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account a lot, this can cause serious damage in devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware breakage, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, be sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used on your computer, you should make sure that all peripherals connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and are therefore very small, and they also contain protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in a uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. some models allow them to continue working until the current runs. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of current problems with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS may be used for less than & euro; 40. at the end, you should always remember to separate all the cables before going on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory in the offer. therewith, they are desasterproof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about this is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. it is rather disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences in the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at present, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle sheet defects on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss for notebooks and 46% for workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage than for example thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know very few viruses and under & Linux; nobody has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most popular file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process in case of a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 stop settings from fundamental physical limits. this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss. thus, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. backup your data frequently to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous or new installation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backups on an external SATA disk. if, then one day, a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget Aircraft: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already said above is a common reason for losing data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two times: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made. this backup is closest to a versioning system with the exception that is only sampled and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">At the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate during the time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to forge a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should review your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc / dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of striserfs if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no more software you can read, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend to you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (Defllate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obligates to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block & quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive it before an original image file, mostly in raw format. XMP adapts to it because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digicam; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were possibly cut off by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them to web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicam; to get. in the Adding a Photos to an album, you will find a description how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When the connection is made, it may take a while. if the connection is established, a feral indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file, photos, movies, music etc. are shown on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that not all information is available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digicam; or editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all. this downloads all the photos from their camera into one album in & digicam;. downloading the photos is not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods of & kde. as soon as you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download Selected. the Selected download button is grayed out until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available for download. these images have not been edited by & digikam right now. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums, sorted as usual folder, will appear in the My Albums section. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digicam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete All. if you only want to delete some, you have to select them first and then delete selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. so, you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully imported into a & edited; album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera screen, you should do this via the camera menu because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can result in duplicate filenames in case you upload photos from different recording galleries to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken to the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two apply the data about the author in the section Standard Autoridentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S, for example. turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name option, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in case of capital letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name of the camera in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the point of time recording to automatically rotate during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, & digicam; the photo in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made, & digicam; use this to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same subalbum. in the section bar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case, & digicam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you must disable this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & edited; you where the pictures should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document, meaning a position indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click, which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; user wishing to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data get into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical classification (manual) and last about manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">The download of the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of the coordinates which are created e.g. from maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European roadmaps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; tries to give you as much control over your workflows as possible. there are many settings that edit the behavior of & Edit. to access these settings, you must select in the Edit menu Setting; set up the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Selecting Action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing. you set the default behavior of & Edit; note if you click on an entry in the main screen.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the relevant IPTC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author: this field should contain the professional description of the photographer. this may be designations such as illustrated photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author, if he is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here since this is the image of another & quot; vendor enquire; if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC fields. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained within the image and not only in the Edit menu; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digikam; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image Editions as embedded captions (JFIF) save in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse-cursor rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; Edit; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions will be edited by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the & digicam; can be set to the default values on this page. however, each time you open the lighting table, these settings are not available. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed pictures. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you are using the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With chroma subsampling it means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of .png files. this operation does not decrease the image quality, as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF Compression option, you can compress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the image quality of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">Even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digicam; image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is developing very quickly to a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default response is that all green pixels are the same. if the pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. this option draws the image a little bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern using the VGA or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your pictures which are burned in, because of the inability of your camera to view the top lights, as a penetrating white. the setting colors trigger creates some unusual results, because they show the top lights in various rose tones. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast saturating like green and red. & digicam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the yet unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1, but this can also be done later in the editing options of the & digicam; image processing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicam; and Drapw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests, it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenes-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Drapw. it produces but color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction since it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digicam; information about how to translate the color information from a color space to the other are thus the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior If an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Place the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the shell file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera creator and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like e.g. Canon, which do not include color mapping or gamma corrections. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof Profile, which allows you to emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface it can & digicam; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and these will be loaded by & digicam; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the Previews.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the picture transitions, normally 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes turn on or off the metadata that are displayed at the bottom of the images while viewing.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in picture display mode. currently, here are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, place it in the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; pictures in the trash bin, you can view & edit the conversation; when deleting a photo in an album. deleting a photo and deleting an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be used tacitly by & digicam; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you must save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & digicam; disable when starting. this will speed up the start process by & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When you start looking for new photos forces & Edit; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the starting time of & edited;. if something was deleted from the base folder, & digitized; you might want to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digibox; used to customize the main window to suit your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Edit: contains a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the entry and selection of the entry Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see Setting Up Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current filename, magnification factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Restore menu or button Restore picture editing button Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting Edit Undo or Restore by selecting Edit restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, use the shortcut keys, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to remember.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the return button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will get a contextual menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions will be reversed or restored in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by moving the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zoom out by using Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you can use the Esc button. if you do not want this, you can change it in the Edit dialog by & Edit; Edit the main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sets. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select Export wizard from the File Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicam; main window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are reshaped. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sortation. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the urgency IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view displays a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with the keywords applied before; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can easily restrict the number of options in search for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification when entering key words in a series of images. if you have entered various keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are saved into the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword Filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop words. suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is reduced to no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off in Settings Different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the checkbox at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have adapted it mainly & edited; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme is on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. additionally, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to get you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your photo workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor which is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are per email or web, where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one then use another color space and thus have to worry about color schemes?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to sound my monitor if I have decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you must calibrate your monitor as sRGB means your; onitor is sRGB. if you are working as sRGB, you either have to calibrate your monitor to sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, reconcile, automatic offset and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the light intensity across the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest dot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similar: this method adjusts the brightness level of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. thus, almost every brightness range has the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces garbage. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Extending contrast: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re-fixing of all values in between. this is only visible in full-blown images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a little limited by working with 8 bits per color over a colour space. so if you are too far away from the original image areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16 bit mode, your possibilities for correction will fail.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whiteness again, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow readjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat around with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the White Balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons are exactly the same. each setting of the white balance you have set can save you into a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this coding needs more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find the color correction file in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously so you can always use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under Colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">This & digicam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was a result of when one replaced a partially developed pressure from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darken and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation Effect. the original is the (1) and it processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Veloaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a converted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. with large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo. you can try to preview the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu of colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem: too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog with this tool appears very complicated, you only need the area of the slide for the application intended here. the three sliders below the histogram are more concrete.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to postpone the controller and to make sure that the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammages.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two control knobs that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later, using the Gimp level format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you can only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiable channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most meaningful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve part to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright notes correspond to darker output tones and darker the corresponding image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos is a red marker. if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly that. each curve that you created can be stored in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp cam format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The over exposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you can only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set using the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicam; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gradations of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and deflection. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the bottom right: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to keep luminance, the image will keep the general brightness too. this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option Monochrome since the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible rushing coming from the color space. colour space consists of small room artifacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you can only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since colour images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Jab4 Plus, Ilford Jab5 Plus, Ilford Panf Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well into portraits to the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at day time, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and enhances the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and redevelopment in a smeatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) smeafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitch an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three-dimensionality of the texture in the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured effect has been used on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological obstacle for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly round the picture with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image at any position. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text alignment, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiblade; apply tool template you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image template menu can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digicam; stencil database, just send an email in English to the & digicam; mailing list digicam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you must place your stencil folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears, which reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder updates the thumbnail of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview you will find three buttons that allow you to change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinks: this button decreases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitalisation process colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn causes blurred edges to be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">For JPEG images a camera is often used for internal sharpness. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool. you can use the menu item Correct sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this, since the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little softly is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to softly mark with the menu entry Chocolate softness and experiment a bit with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Non-sharp mask is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred picture that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. this allows for a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between tones are excluded and therefore beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example for the blurred masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicam; tool refocused refocusing an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted design-filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocussing usually reaches better results than fuzzy masking. you can start it from the menu by calling colors re-focus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fold is much better than the Gauß-Faltung. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the swelling spots, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna inverse of the Gauß-Faltung is very strongly influenced by the remote pixels, causing undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular fold. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation decreases the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will further mitigate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness is statistically caused. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase of the die size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circle-shaped sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this might be caused by the blurring masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it is impossible to remove the effect of the sharpness. in practice, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob blends the blurring of the area that is darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink provides a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cima project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use tab and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a movie grain or CCD Space, a high value is generated wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothes [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing effect over all. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-step width as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value of less 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor, but it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend it to skip it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Load exactly do this. correcting any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is used in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is an odd black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor movie storage during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and Rauschen or Schmiere occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks may occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more strongly smoked.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be saved to the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for softening with the menu entry Chocolate softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauze's hiss, film baskets, scratches, compression artefacts and local faults that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cima project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are to be seen in uncompressed image. this setting is intended to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Load exactly do this. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time using the button Beading.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures can be reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts created by the scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">This & digicam; tool Hotpixel allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels & quot; bright pixel quot; and quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button darker. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1 dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to compute a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1 dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, applied from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, in particular those in the medium and large photo format, cannot illuminate the entire sensor area equally. instead & quot; vignettisation ot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise blurring effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure areas of today's filaments and the grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without these filters. the tool vignetting correction turns the transformation using a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the highest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or random a light intensity of 2, reduce the density to a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree conducts the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounding effect but flat on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade fixes the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree. with negative values, distortion-like distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">This value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lentils the 'Corner parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter' general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resscaled the image size, resulting in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the Preview dialog illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The toning or kissing correction should be performed before any trimming or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a tonne-shaped correction, the effect would seem evidently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. then move the mouse cursor in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards you can correct the sound / kissing distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transformations trimming from image editing or via the zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as photographs from front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. be aware that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonne-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film of GimpGuru.org website that is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film gradation and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the Option Add movie grains if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator alters the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter blends color channels for reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The effect of the film gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to check the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and this worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and still lifes are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two control knobs to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suitable for large pictures.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines that outline the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sketch out yourself. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two control knobs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob adjusts the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digicam; filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing on the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Beading.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurring the image along star shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurry the image by turning the pixels around a center point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shotgun: blurry the image due to accidental shifting of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blurring: finds the color basins in the image and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the picture into rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Beading.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it a wet appearance to your images. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows changing the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with & digicam; image processing a range of free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain uncovered. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools can be found in the Transform Rotate menu or Transform Switches menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of picture quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm which is used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change the size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the size tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, try to blow the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to increase an image. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo blaster was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cima project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. enlarge any stallying for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small image to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cropping of a photo is not only a frequently used operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries File Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly-cut picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">When cutting to the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the transverse format of the width are always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the editing tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help make it possible to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaflets of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed their temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. there should be something that distracts the eye in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirroring and vertical mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonic content.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it's easy that you do not hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digicam; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose Transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right corner.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transform cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is to cut the function Automatically. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the center of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New Width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle at the top left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the upper right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle at the bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little smeared. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you will get triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Prune your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets blurred. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two notes generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing the picture has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove it is to cut the picture with the transformation of the image from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, of the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below them.</seg>

<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. this reduces redundant information in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG for the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by & digicam; in the Configuration section you will find more information about how to use modules with & digicam;.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, softness, noise suppression, refocusing, blurring, & etc; use a uniform type of dialog which indicates the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you will see & quot; texture applicable quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. on the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or graph in & kgraphicsv; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & cGraphviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the graph; -Tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphicsv; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zoom is restricted in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a current & kgraphicsv instance, & eg; in the file browser or the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new or cGraphviewer; or if you want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to divide the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Download page gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (reload automatically or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">You can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the current session) or determine that each time you are asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraphicsv. you can set a default behavior (open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBs, opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among various & graphviz; -layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the web page of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungrounded graphene. it produces representations according to the spring-spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistic multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; -algorithm creates a spring-spring model for ungrounded graphene. it uses the Frucman Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; -algorithm arranges the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and specify the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of the graph (directed or ungerified) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for ungrounded graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this option is checked, the overview is shown, if necessary. otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows what is the mouse pointer. click on a & GUI element with this mouse pointer to get further help to this element (if any).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the base folder of the source archive.</seg>
<seg id="759">& cGraphviewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; -Tools for displaying. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraphicsv; in the Settings menu you will find more options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid net, in which you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">When the current file has been modified, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. after that, a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template, or whether you want to start anew from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="763">If you haven't made any step undo, this function is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="764">Inserts the clipboard contents as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="765">Sets the current symbol in grey scales. this can create colors that do not coincide with those of the symbol range of & kde;</seg>
<seg id="766">Does not change the symbol but sets the current character color to the color of the point you click on.</seg>
<seg id="767">The status bar shows you the current actions. from left to right, it shows you the x- and y-coordinates of the current pixel, the size of the current drawing area, the magnification factor and the current number of colors of the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="768">Inserts the clipboard contents as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="769">Open with Settings & kiconedit; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols, background and symbol grille.</seg>
<seg id="770">With the buttons adding..., Edit... and Removing you can change the templates for standard file, source file, Compressed File & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="771">Select Transparent pixels or display rulers and set up one colored: or a chessboard as a transparent display. you can also adjust the size for the chessboard: choose the karos on small, medium and large as well as the color 1: and Color 2: choose.</seg>
<seg id="772">The KIPI module read images provides tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. for this to work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the File Scan menu, a dialog appears which lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select here the source you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values ducroth own to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image. read more about the estimated file size in the Kooka manual.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the Scan button, you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screenshots can be created after you have selected the Import &gt; Screen shot in the Import &gt; Screen. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have picked the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot is made, the dialog window appears with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module Calendar does not currently have any documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the internet. with Flickr it is possible to send your photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "the" "" "Flickr" "" "module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="798">When you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. it is practically your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented to you following a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog showing the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, you do not need any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add photo should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, uploading the photos to Flickr Server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keyword field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as key during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the option to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading. the size is taken from the value registered with Maximum Size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The Maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module Galerie Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Galerie-Export has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic location module provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears then. to run a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same time in the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation, which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation from below the data is merged, the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have a track data from a place for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add it to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolation and difference in min. can be used if you don't have matching data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates from one call to the next you just have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set using the displayed map. select the respective region and enlarge sie.Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tabs are not hierarchically displayed. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Dexterity Show</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab record defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth, which of course also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab preview images allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the program messages to determine if errors occur during creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation, zoom or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a full screen image is displayed by default. this can be changed to a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases, since no compression of the color information takes place.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Digital Camera Client module is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the KIPI mailinglist kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the Metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied by clicking the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video with a defined length. this module uses the Packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a base image transition. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for your DVD player. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the pictures you want to pack into the MPEG slide show. after that you can launch the module via Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio section. you can also change the sorting of images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to reproduce the file on a TV, you need to choose the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds an image is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let them black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the mpg as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your wishes, you can start the production of the movie using the button coding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gimp. this is useful e.g. to improve you or print out with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your RAW files into one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from it is: expect dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera creator. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance should be used. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your pictures frequently or you may later use them otherwise, you should not select the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality worsens. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at a time. use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images you selected. by clicking the Add Images button you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview on the right-hand side will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures onto the image list and drop them there to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails to send. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in image file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, searching for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation selects very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The Show file name option ensures that the file name of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually terminate it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The Option Pictures randomly select the images displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, every transition between the pictures selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your images and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; Browse through these, see image. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now in each group, thus in people, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you hit People with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons are to be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, locations and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save a thumbnail image, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the names, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must choose which image to display for each individual. to do this, you must select the image view window (described in detail) and select the image for the respective person. in the View window you can customize the image for the respective person. in the View window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search function in the main window, you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for determining the image properties. you can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the label or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you would like, you can also enter a date after which you want to be searched; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images according to specific names, as you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User Manual for & Photo Album; if you don't like reading manuals, but rather want to try similar features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & Photo Album; and watch the Quick Start, screenshots and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & Photo Album; and in the first dialog select the demo if you start & Photo Album; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample pictures will be loaded and you can check out the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">Each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries previewed from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be shown in the preview window) and the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will be able to cancel the selection by clicking on a bar on the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create through the menu File html....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to set some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether to create a & kphotoalbum; -export file that is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer. for example, that all images are of a party. note that all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not addressed in particular.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 have no more images, which for example have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set. thus, it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transfer time. if he wants to get a bigger picture, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, choose a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them to it. to enable the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have changed all three to base folders and URLs. a subfolder is created in these settings, the name of which you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time for it, you need to do with & kphotoalbum; this work does not go once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Photo Album; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external ones. they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images to the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it scans the images found in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file by HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can invoke through the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is supposed to be internal or external .kim files. you will have the following three choices:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy manually to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copy to .kim file, copy & photoalbum; images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying, for example, that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import pictures are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you will personalize the category of people of the imported file (if you are a domain), while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, in the third dialogue window, you will be asked what categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups. for example, if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) Designating information on your images, through (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images, but it has been extended and today your videos are also taken care of. in many places in this manual you talk about images, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want them.</seg>
<seg id="950">& Kphotoalbum; remember the folder where your images are stored and will automatically reuse it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start a different folder tree with images, you can use the -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Go to a window with which you can modify the settings of & Photo Album; in the following section of the user manual, the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons, which allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, such as people, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can view the dialog used to process already existing groups. you can select a label and a symbol for each existing group.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list box above you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& Kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules of several applications are used together, it may be that the modules were tested with & Kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should first test new modules using the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't tell me, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & Kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order after albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to hand over a list of albums. here's a photo album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category persons, & kphotoalbum; so do so, so whether you would have selected persons to view and pass on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are not compatible with & kphotoalbum, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & Photo Album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to any other KDE application, see the menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar, you will see the window that you can browse through your image database. in the section, we will return to that window, but now click on the image that shows you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons on the picture, where the image has been recorded etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images simultaneously. if, for example, on all pictures, Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for browsing and browsing as described in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">Here you can see three lists with a text box by setting up people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always be using them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images inside the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and the same 5-10 persons are shown on all 50 pictures, you can, by moving the names used up, find and classify people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting symbol on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any comments for each image individually, you may still want to edit all selected images and annotate these images with annotations. simply click on the front and back buttons below to preview the image.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an over-group. to show you that it is an over-group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and place it there to sort it into a subcategory of this entry. note, this requires you to sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the Comment dialog by clicking and dragging the paste that forms the top edge of the box. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a box. if you want to get this window again later, use the Options button... and then window / hide this window. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or of all images if you do not set filters. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as wallpaper for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, it will appear in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview screen. simply select the respective images you want to delete and either click the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; you can also use pictures anywhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can record the pictures anywhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & Photo Album; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images on which the upper right corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive. however, for images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; however, you can't view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back. if you want to avoid hassle, how to avoid the confusion of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the View menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end ones you want to make accessible to others, click on the current view and lock the menu entry All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Thus you have set which pictures should be hidden in case of the case. if you give the laptop now to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, whereby all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on the lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select a password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">On the one hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml may read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid looking at private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & photo album; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them at some point. for this reason & kphotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. these can be started from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he naturally shows the picture, but additional information you have entered through the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box is on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer you can drag in and out in the image. to zoom in, you can zoom in with the mouse. with the minus button you can zoom out the zoomt Plus key again in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. using the DC key sets the zooms, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turning functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work for videos. you can make annotations to the current image with the menu item Notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can cancel the look and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you might prefer to just highlight the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with characteristics as you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters. in view a picture in which the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have added features to your images, these are available in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you choose, you simply have to use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview pane. if you can view categories in the preview pane, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will allow you to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to stop painting mode from & kphotoalbum, select View on the image from the context menu. to end the painting just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeling; work, you need to use the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Add menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to allow you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Delete selected objects from the scene with deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply and discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click on thumbnail in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. by default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check out locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag them with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility Level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">The object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window ordering or if you need a different configuration, you can adjust it arbitrarily. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will show the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner right in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card tabs at the top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are pending views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the beginner to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing left in the beginner bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the beginner bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with the View window. a dialog will appear where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 is currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering symbol Rendering the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Mode menu, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can type any name, but it makes sense, however, a name that lets you know the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the image detail to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality drop down selector you can select the properties that are used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual on & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the second method is adaptive, non-recursive. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is divided up and down again and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the default threshold, then both pixels will be calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are tracked separately and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to let a scene be calculated with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can indicate whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly completed, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray scene, select Import Remove File... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command-range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your retention and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. here you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a better wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detailed fidelity for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections. this property results in better approximation for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall is rendered back behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a bottom is rendered underneath the objects. the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick channel smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the Pane Regulations you will be explained how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector Standard window ordering: displays all existing window configurations. and kpovmodeler; uses the selected window ordering at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Existing window orders list shows all existing window orders. a new order can be created by the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created by the button Add and Delete selected views with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with Unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating encapsulates the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window ordering:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">To follow this guide, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. thus you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. when you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a checkpoint and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or enter the input key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a fader (inserting infinite body boxes) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited final level. when you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can unfold the item for the floor by clicking on the + before the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should shift the floor to practice one unit below the horizon line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but in the moment you select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please choose first subobject. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matte black material, because you still have to enter the pigment settings. so please always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see color on boxes and balls in the preview, click Apply first and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select each time monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to carry out this step, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeling; the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input key or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor, since you have shifted the floor around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, place a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subjects and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effects and reflection already have some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the rendering hypothetically shoots from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect. so the scene is processed pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the image is just black. obviously, every scene that is to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restore the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage have been discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can select this menu item only if you still have not saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last annotated command. you can select this menu entry only if you have used Edit Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window ordering and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeling; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can change or add new shortcuts for & kpovmodeler commands with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbars. you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump-map is a possibility to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic objects are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic objects. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view using the & LMBs or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can indicate whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a particular file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a suitable filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Configuration - & kuickshow; there are five cards. in three of these, General and editing and Slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for the respective windows.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Configure Soft the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions more information about the new piece queries (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files in the playlist, if a custom menu item is clicked. to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; finished, or when the user stops a script, & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. cleaning operations. this includes storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archive (.tar) which can optionally also be zipped with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with an extension amarolscript. for this reason, you should immediately rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the rest to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can reload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; append. for your entry on kde apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1229">The audio output card card lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers still activate other settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection, including the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok, to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok to browse both the crossed and their subfolders to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enable & Amarok; to monitor selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>

<seg id="1241">Get a similar performer: after activating this setting, & Amarok, a list of similar interpreters will be retrieved to the played piece. you can view the list in context-browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to build kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedattop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause trouble, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the times, this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of the used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok, compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens in case of a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in meta-info, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl die "$ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = $mp3 &gt; get _ v2tag; print _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: catokapp: symbol lookup error: catokapp: undefined icon: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7Qpixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can see this using ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any existing Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. they can also help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; appears only an empty playlist. how do music pieces get there now?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To control the user interface intuitively, the Start subwindow has been converted to the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from Playlist Remove from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it down exactly as you would do with other files. it's as simple as: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the toolbar of the playlist, right next to the Add button, you will find the Playlist button. click on it.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses one from the backend independent approach, therefore the real question must be: what kind of media types does GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you see, we support pretty much any imaginable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It can! perhaps you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which in default no MP3 decoders are included (due to patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, input key</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously audio. this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in search of the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer you might need to provide another sinking (e.g., osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only listen to a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Even XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Either use the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. activate Control Centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x, there are problems with KDE multimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia completely to get the faster arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been greatly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Centre and Sound & Multimedia, Sound System. the smaller the buffer, the less dreamers react the visualizations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to change to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; ab. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installation of GStreamer, you need to register all components. follow the register-register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with the mpeg-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1344">The context-browser contains three sub-windows: music, Text and Interpret. these three sub-windows will be explained later in detail. they provide information about the current piece to different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the sub-window has dropped off. the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Tools statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click this icon to follow the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time, as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">The images may have arbitrary names, but images with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context-browser will also display cover images embedded either with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "among the pieces" "" "Recommended pieces" "" "are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this area displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will pop up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok will attempt to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running yet, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required for this.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to artist and below will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / year - Album - Sorted according to artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Artist - their pieces are first sorted by genre and among them according to artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album under the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine grouping as desired.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you have something to change to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located right under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection box, with which help you can filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year. furthermore, you can also choose your entire collection, whereby the filter is practically disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set the pieces in queue mode - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Saves the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player. see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter will burn / burn to CD - therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the garbage bins... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Set up selection mark - Change a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. after that, the album will not be displayed under different interpreters but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes handling many playlists easy. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Also, smart playlists created by yourself are possible. click on Add Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindows will be used for connecting & Amarok; for example, your iPod with & Amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; when & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpret sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpret. if you are done, click Apply.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The search function is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all the files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. for example, enter / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press enter key, you can access music in the music file Musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of the Shift key can be difficult. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: thus dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired position. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by spaces separate search terms, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter one two three, the search will find all the entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you would like to search for entries containing white spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries found by Mike Oldfield, but not by entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: review: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you would like to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key and then right-click on the entries in the desired order. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar you find a unique, magnifier analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button. through this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed by clicking double in the corresponding display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Click on this entry to open the Visualization Plugins window. there you can select the Visualizations of & Amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a sub-menu with links to this document and other information on & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to display in the cover management. select:</seg>
<seg id="1409">After you have set a piece into the queue, a number next to the title appears in the playlist. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already predetermined (details on how to set up these later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add songs based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: audio-enabled). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a load .fm profile to make this dynamic playlist work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click the playlist you want, drag it to the playlist window or right-click on it and then select Load. that way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlist Mix instantly fill in your playlist and you can add at least one piece from your collection. the pieces that are recommended will be added at least one piece from your collection, so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: dynamic Mode Settings. this will use your existing playlist as the starting point.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New Fill button completes the current playlist and adds new pieces in accordance with the dynamic mode. edit Playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">With a right click on a dynamic playlist, you have the option to click Edit. then the dialog will open to edit the playlist settings.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist, but the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will continue to grow, the setting for upcoming pieces will be skipped and they will not hear a play in this playlist. however, if the setting is active, the already played pieces will be removed while respecting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces have been recently played.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist according to each played piece. if you set more than 1 here, the playlist will continue to grow, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right side are already described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog you can select already existing playlists and smart playlists. if you tick more than one playlist, & Amarok, you can add random pieces from each of the playlists you have crossed.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts will allow your own settings. you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking Configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & Amarok; scripts, by clicking on script. it will open a selection dialog where you can select a script package to install. after you have installed the script, a new entry will appear on the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1426">If you don't want to use a script anymore, you can delete it. select the script to delete and then click Uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="1427">If you are looking for information on writing your own scripts, please refer to Scripting Scripts section.</seg>
<seg id="1428">The dialog window Visualization Plugins is used to activate the available visualizations in & Amarok; the window contains a list of all available plugins. to use a plugin, simply enable the check box next to the name.</seg>
<seg id="1429">This Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD with & k3b; in four steps you need to create an audio CD. to understand the steps, you need to have an executable installation of & k3b; and have a folder with audio files.</seg>
<seg id="1430">This is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD.</seg>
<seg id="1431">If you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other lossy formats, remember that when reencoding to MP3 you will get a worse quality, no matter how high the bitrate is. you can check if an audio CD was created by a lossy format. use the project auxtect.</seg>

<seg id="1443">& cdrecord; / mkisofs;: burns all kinds of CD-Rs. & cdrecord; has all the functions that also & cdrecord; offers, and extends these functions even. therefore, & k3b; usually automatically & cdrecord; usually automatically & cdrecord; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1444">Cdparanoia: a program for reading digital audio data from a CD (CDDA - Compact Disc Digital Audio).</seg>
<seg id="1445">OGG Vorbis library: OGG Vorbis is a completely open, patent-free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio streams. OGG Vorbis profits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3. this library is used by Ogg Vorbis decoder and encoder modules.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Mad: this is a high-quality MPEG Audio decoder. it currently supports MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG 2.5. all three audio layers Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (e.g. MP3) are fully supported. this library is used by the MP3 decoder module.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Lame: a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial encoders. lame is used by the MP3 encoder module.</seg>
<seg id="1448">FLAC: a free open source codec for lossless audio compression and decompression. it is used by the FLAC decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLAC files.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Libsndfile, ffmpeg, FLAC, Musepack decoder: more libraries for processing different audio formats. with ffmpeg, for example, it is possible to decrypt WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD. deco</seg>

<seg id="1452">VCDIMager: an authoring system fully equipped for editing, disassembling and analysing video CDs and super video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Normalize: this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level. this can be useful for creating mixed CD's and Mp3 collections; without a normalize, the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the indefinite effect that the music pieces play differently loudly.</seg>
<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient method of reloading recently opened projects. the corresponding sub-menu contains a list of these projects. clicking on an entry will open the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. once the project has been saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new filename.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new filename. KDE's Dialog Save As is displayed, with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Save all opened projects. this is the same as if you would call for each project file Save.</seg>
<seg id="1459">If a project changes and has not yet been saved, ask & k3b; ask what should happen. you can then discard the closing and make the project so open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Closes all opened projects. & k3b; will ask for any unsaved project what should happen with it, just as if you have called for each project file Close.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Includes all opened projects and finished & k3b;. for each unsaved project you will be asked what to do with it, as if you had called file closing.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you access this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog. this has the same effect as if you want to move the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; for burning the medium. the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can set up many project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described by the What is the? aid (accessible by the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful if you do not use files for a multi-session CD. it is meant for you rather than help, so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function removes any files from the media, it only fades the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This also allows you to create only a copy of a CD, which you can then burn later. you should prefer cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Alternatively, you can only create an image of a DVD, which you can then burn later. in addition, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of copy dialog is not yet supported, therefore the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW, so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), whereby the content is completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between the write modes overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog will ask you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a source of data which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">The dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a source of data which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even possibilities to change the size and cut black margins.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium, such as size and title length of CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbar of & k3b; when an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents are displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it only looks pretty and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can customize the mapping assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended for personalisation and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, through a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the contributors will give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; start. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & k3b provides features such as copyCD, formatDVD and other features to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixCD Project () DCOPRef currentProject () void copy.dvd () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring name, Qstring)) void add1Item (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring NewName) void set VolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT address / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio creator; is an audio CD; - reader for & kde;. with it, easily audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -data encoded in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encoding these WAV files (lossy compression) by default (This encoders packages need to be installed from the Linux distribution). further encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the tracks of the & CD; read and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or in other formats like lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all of these programs are generally not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? chapter Welcher Kodicer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudio creator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the CD; / DVD device avoids protection, it is not possible to bypass any copy protection.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up should only be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), then the daily handling to read a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; fetch information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the commands of the main window. step by step, you will find more information about how this program is used and screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB starts the CDDB request according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet must be established first.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it must be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (such as logs, pics) for program events (such as reading & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with various flashcards (such as encoder, to set up the encoder). you must go here before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly any commercially available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (high bit rates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset Medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex pieces of music and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR, shared stereo, compression ratio about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car steroids. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or automatically fetched from freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use with & kaudio creator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudio creator must be added; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the Assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note the translator) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being harmed by the CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; actively select a check box. for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the one in the system. in this way of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has verified the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freedb, the nearest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides an up-to-date list of mirror servers for online access from & CD; information during read-out on & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this has not been done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oye c (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oye c for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; do not want to read the cover of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, for example, as it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something into it with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting up of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read & record a CD; what needs to be repeated for each CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the encoders to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (.mp3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freedb to load the freedb to download the CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any readout of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM drives and / or DVD drives will help.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map menu General Settings. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just select in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card-card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you later are unhappy with the database entry and the resultant directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory or file name is changed with Konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first one.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data request, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, as many firewalls install the 8880 protocol as standard, there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. to disable the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take over the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously discharging pieces: sorry, there's one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: check this to the CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then the path / folder can be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files are created in the private folder. do not forget that folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as shown on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extremely 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set up of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as a standard for each readout of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been set up in the previous section, since we are comfortable and the CD; data from the freedb. the process described in this section must be repeated for each release & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data collected from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done yet, the CD now has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only if the CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look at the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces have already been filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there, a window will be displayed, and you can select the database entry that best fits your opinion to your & CD;.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you did not select the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger by choosing the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - entry of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "the artist no longer has to be entered in the field of" "" "Current Title" "", "unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album can be used for individual comments, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot below. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist's and album name (e.g. whether all words start with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment section. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also re-create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoding and file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD; in this example, this is not important since we do not send the CD; for more information go to freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first part. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title dates of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece into or out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All Remove button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the Select button to start reading the reading process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the jobs and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">On the tab, click on orders to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the bottom left part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error when trying to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we typed here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows to read and code in parallel. notice the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. the computer with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of though two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions already contain a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; some of an important package. if you read this, you probably already did it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is intended for people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help such as the program can be adjusted to your needs once it runs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the various flashcards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still to read? even if only the Help menu was clicked after the start of the program, without any reference point as it should continue from this somewhat empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program start), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? if you read this, you probably have already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual on & kaudiocreator. whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it. at least only after contacting with the author. and if you read this, he left this section and is therefore agreeing with that suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played in series. this section shows how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. these can be found in the collection menu under the point Organizing.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>

<seg id="1643">If automatic add-in to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the pop-up sequence of the menu selection menus, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the Collection Manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next song, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>

<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & mid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates General-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which transforms all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sound a trumpet when a piano should originally play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and Gus cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap..." END Define Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This topic describes how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM -patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">For example, if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun signal. add the following to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (a gun), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) will play 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards own it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to depict sounds on the percussion channel. take a look as an example of the included key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will need to be defined further forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on that channel. in this case, always use Patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard that gets a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, is supposed to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played notes. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can result in very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, check Automatically add to the collection. otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default pace, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have open a & konqueror; -Window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a MIDI file) merely in the & konqueror; -windows change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file fast without adding it to a collection, turn off the Automatically add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play Bmid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards to me. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to write to & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrose.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the university of Maacute; Malaga. I'm studying mathematics at the university of Maacea, but I try to take a bit of time. as a hobby I have to program, collect MIDI files, make music and prove sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an expansion of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a great joy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or MIDI file, I will contact my friends by & kmid. if you send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I wrote & kmid; completely written in my spare time and didn't get money from anyone. I would like to stress that I only want to continue programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the Gus support, Ignacio Garcia, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter Gritsch, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, bug notification or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course I would like to thank all these excellent musicians on the web, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on its homepage which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with further karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends significantly on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile it with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then works as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If any problems occur, contact one of the & kde mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called anddoable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections in the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Continuous Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level. if you click on an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, select from the menu View and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the playlist from the Edit menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable other animation. & SMB; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayers / DATA.xml and ~ / .kde / share / DATA.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during starting does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end animation however, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>

<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the 'console' button in the tool bar of SMB. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; all needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like setting the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how to play 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SMB; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialogue file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or SMB Player; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there is no error, the backend output inside & SMB; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always take a given backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can be played by TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer is the dialogue in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvd in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support for SMB only supports XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SMB uses various names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation this is dvdNAsource, exitsource, introspsource, pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource, and vdr. when they are enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any clues how to quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be executed as root after mounting the device. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts up slowly, why does each time my CPU have to be tested for its performance?</seg>

<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. this should be a quotation, a few places in bold and italics and a poem to apply to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor-View or Ctrl E can return to the editor (for internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">These files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can start using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search query allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this, only Modern under Settings box must be set up... Tools building can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the preferential search, the mouse-cursor has to be positioned in one line of the source text and clicked on. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then made.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button on the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; Put document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. for this, & Kile; in & Okule; set as text editor (setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using the & DVI viewer, an error can be found. if there is an error, it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file erases the error source in the source code. in the editor, the heads of LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤dster LaTeX errors can be used for sprints between the errors. to view the faulty row, the error in logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the faulty row.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ufige users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file is created.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced with other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings boxes... Settings can be set in General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by the entry in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {Exarticle}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and latex; -files. if a simple way is used to create a template, search for a template on the Internet and follow the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (among them also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & cate; can be done in menu Tools directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate;.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference that can be called over the menu LaTeX Reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. this means that in this way, clicking\\ par\\ bigskip is just\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Using the arrow keys with the Shift key pressed, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search and highlight the different types of source code. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumps within the text. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the menu items Edit jump-marks or the corresponding button root allow the jump to the next or last jump-mark. this is also highlighted with this jump-mark, so that it is automatically applied when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & Kile; Even though & kate; already excellent possibilities offers, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is added; and therefore support & kick; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">This extended meaning is meant to include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventable thing in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command is also & latex; -commands with a click swab (\\) and an additional star (*) to the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, natural this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Cate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit Select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands under Edit surroundings for a more simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or within the\\ begin {ambient} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command completes the last modified environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups defined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from Edit surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the closing clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the softened clamp of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested curly groups braces can quickly get lost. this command completes the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already offers a good source code completion, it has been expanded in & Kile; to accommodate special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of these modes are implemented for automatic completion. all of these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings boxes... to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {Environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and possible, thus the complete list of letters is displayed. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command. alternatively, by & Kile; hock marks may also be added, so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by editing hock marks NÃ ¤hoste jump-mark and then the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... boxes; you can make adjustments to these lists. there can be different wiper lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of completion mode will result in a large list with environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the completion mode over menu item Alt + Shift key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment completion can be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the input key will be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; realises that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings... boxes; set up... boxes; customize settings to these lists. this mode uses the wiper list of the completion mode for & tex; - and latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of abbreviations, which can immediately be replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... boxes can be set up. as an example of a check list the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode introduced over the menu item Ctrl + Alt key key, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great WÃ ¶ rters are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many WÃ ¶ rters are written more than once in a document. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written schemes.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu Setting Kile... boxes can be disabled. here, the threshold value for the display of completion can also be specified.</seg>

<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and annotations. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions performed when something is happening in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later, how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file in CVS once it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the site Event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Preferences dialog can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Annotations are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">It can be either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname of the recruited nickname of the team member is, role plays a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the parentheses and the: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here is expelled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here is expelled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly so that in case of a power outage or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed in the Editor area or in its own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree during editing and how deep during a change in the structure tree can be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are in groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid, divided. this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the ifclause abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed. plugins are KON applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-capable application, the best known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in the "Read Only" mode: check if the plugin refuses the load. only-read-parts usually refuse charging if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; whether the entered information is correct. select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept has been implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the Debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugins in the project settings. using the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the contents of the monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is usually displayed in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requests. this action is fired by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The object to debugger session starts the session. includes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debug request has started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without providing information about the variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debugging requirement is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is asked.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next script in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next script in the script, whereby if possible, it will be blended in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and proceed to the next as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored parameter appears in the variable view.</seg>

<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder enter the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better viewing and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as a single element type about itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the base class name for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">When yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. in addition, it contains further tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed, etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Prints the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped the elements of a list together. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each attribute; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each field; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be chained and closed properly.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Whitespace doesn't affect anything, but look & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML file, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and select TagXML. a further dialog will appear, with its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">Currently, this function is not available. currently, the check is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; Over-loading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Edit DTD settings. thus diedescriptionrc; for a new & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should be created a simple descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut keys assigned to this action. by clicking on the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but this is not limited) that modify the document or use as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we substituted the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be attached to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be specified, which can be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard error output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the given case it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them, enable dialog "Edit Tag" when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we & kiconedit; use. choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconcurrent; used by default 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the icon created does not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered loosely, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user be signaled that clicking this symbol is added; startles; -tag will be inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, as there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar and set the toolbar button. make sure the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After neweXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust its file descriptionrc, so that its toolbar (s) is loaded (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone did that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second one we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html tag2 = tag1.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation so:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation tab of Contents = index.html getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders on the tree with its own contents. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Whitespace doesn't affect anything, but watch & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation should be displayed for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of submerged context elements to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / s / Quanta / doc for local and global usage. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you won't be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email-sending menu entry, such as the DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download it. to make a contribution, we recommend to sign the resources, which requires a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your passphrase for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the Save New Resource, the input fields have to be filled (URL preview can be empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) menus, upload tool toolbar, and begin in the context menu of files and folders in the Template and Scripts Tree context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and marking. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, creating a DTEP package can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in everyday XML format. there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination Directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definition bar: the string that appears in! Doctype Tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and to be able to draw full use of & quantaplus, you first have to familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. from toolbars about actions, everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to backup different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS, patterns to tool bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are laid in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the joint use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the tabs with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all the tabs, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execute CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor pane to create a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of the tool bar, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want a single day, e.g. & lt; pgt; insert into their document, then click on the symbol representing the tag. if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog box different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and strip them. in the display with tabs for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation, tree views are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that & quantaplus; provides. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; all options are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the scripting languages available. the concept of integration into Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can call the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can easily change attributes and namespaces with it. the entry system aligned to the contents enables the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development. it is possible to download prepacked documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be appended, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs on the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed specify all error messages (if any) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the chocolate page of the toolbars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure it in & quantaplus; as any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of its bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a stand-alone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolute greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why develop what already someone else has developed? thanks to & kde; -smells is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost any task. by the program commani, they can be expanded without having to memorize any language syntax.

<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list always changes when you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the templates section. should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project default folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and whitespace in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script displays error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Starting and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar at the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries preceding or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files to the server in your project. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project managed. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set using settings actions... added. toolbars are saved by toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removed a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't yet saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (possibly at the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the upload of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; which has made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP; should be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or deactivating the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantaplus; when inserting by tool bar, this tag does not contradict the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed below the menu items listed above. click on them.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes take time or cause unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & Kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after filling out the project name, the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (eg foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host configuration, an adaptation may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, etc;) you have to proceed in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If a project is started from scratch, if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded to the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the subwindows profiles or changed using the Shift; F7 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible) that are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the debugger. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Upload profiles (see in) can be set in the Profiles sub-window, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by showing your own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete actions. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you cannot influence this behavior at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the icon project open from the toolbar. the Open Project Open Project will be displayed and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files finds. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives you free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behaves as well, however the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the files uploaded. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if there is only one profile, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten on programs. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog box if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read simply, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, that is, by simply swap the view, various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which you have to do the most. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows adaptation of & quantaplus; to your own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus; best stackable via the toolbar. using and adding is different. adding tool bars is treated below in the section Adding toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons on it can be set using context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, and other actions like toolbar can be removed, which can be specified in the dialog, where indicated which actions should be displayed on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">& quantaplus; templates are basically like a usual file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are usually found in template-tree among global templates. more information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. usually, more specialized documents are written in corresponding subfolders. one makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes working in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found in template tree among global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template but the same text area again and again in the documents. you can find everything from a final note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples can be found in template tree among global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve all websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure combined in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template Save As a local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template Save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged along with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Binary templates are simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files and choose site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, the project folder is backed up, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can provide headers and footers or dynamically create with & PHP; design, insert or link files to them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in subwindows templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the template table with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as elemental attributes are halved.</seg>
<seg id="2212">If a root folder is set so, it would disable templates in this path, except they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to provide a complete presentation with the appropriate headers / footers by copying contents templates to a folder with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you have a context menu (pointing to it, press right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which are accessible via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; Editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -side and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the Vohandance of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one except that the changes both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor. by pressing F9 this mode is already active, the key press moves the active cursor from one window to another, while the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; -View you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click in the list enables the modification of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible like in a word processor, moving with arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. the marking functions as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deletes with the return key or removed button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, has to be removed every other anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar buttons such as the spreadsheet assistant or the list wizard are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool to study style sheets. unlike other style sheets programs, searching for certain elements is possible and the style template can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To be able to compile successfully & xsldbg; you need the libxslt, libexslt and libxml libraries that are already available at a typical installation of & kde.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Stop in a template, at a point in a style or xml file loaded by xsldbg or at the current node. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb-compatibility mode, orphaned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg returns the complete path from a filename without path input. filenames in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con xsldbg Is, for example, a styling file.. / en / xsldoc.xsl, the following entry is possible:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In this command, a partial or complete agreement with a Vorage named myQNAPcloud or a specified model name will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Each namespace in the named "QNAP" is extended according to the rules defined by the namespace defined in the XSL source file. xsl: test1 becomes & eg; extended to http: / / www.w3.org / 199 / XSL / Transform: test1</seg>
<seg id="2233">A required holding point must be resolved for the corresponding URI and line number. this is automatically done when loading the initial template by xsldbg. stopping points are re-checked shortly after the start of each iteration.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & K diff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines. and there was no clue in the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & Kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful if two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps with comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; with Folder Merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are available in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows you to manually type file names, select the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences will be done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By selecting a folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but a folder for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and placing of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info row of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for this is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. with some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have lines. if the line break is activated, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has an info line with the wording edition:, the filename and [GeBE] if you edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Jump to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, any difference at the same time must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this also creates a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">This text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marker you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignoring the options, or activating Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in any of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insert button, you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merge operation and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-picture downhill) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the clipboard to the clipboard, you have to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). if this is enabled, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and no manual copying. be careful with this option, because you might overwrite the clipboard contents by mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix versions use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDef3 does not retain the line end of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically during shutdown and restored at the next start. (set up Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width for selection, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic font will be displayed. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed asterated. on these systems the button presets automatically adjusts an unfaded colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection will be copied automatically to the clipboard. manual copying to the clipboard is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line of line you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system you use.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 first tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\' at the end of one line, others only store a newline '\', but then, files with different sizes may look identical in the page-to-page comparison, but this option might be disabled as a white character. during merging this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unsolved conflict continues.</seg>
<seg id="2335">(default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merging menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge. check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, the original version is appended to suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to & K diff3; stop and restart so that the change becomes active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the top setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding a quick reference appears, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress upsets of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; & gt; C or B & lt;</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just exit the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge again, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor, which fits exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command was specified (see above), then the output of the command is used for line comparison. you can write your own pre-processor, which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to provide the user with more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\).</seg>
<seg id="2353">$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you're experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDef3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for line spacing. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Each sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something other like perl -p -e's / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for display and merging. further operations only alter the data that the newline algorythmus looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or hidden differences, you may inadvertently not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a suggestion for merging; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge operation and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify the folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small news window informs you about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folders is complete, & kdiff3 shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All sub-directories can be opened and all subdirectories can be opened with which you can open or fold all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double-clicking a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action can not be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries varies.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire contents are identical. then folders have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirty.The colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The Synchronization mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchronizes directories. then select & kdiff3; select the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New File instead of Merge (unsure) is enabled, then explores & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the same date, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. As long as such bugs are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is executed after the other. it shows skill when the merge succeeds, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is ok all over.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, KDef3 will show further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, C will be used as the destination in the Three-Folder Merge mode, B is chosen as destination and A and / or B are used as target when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge operation / continue in the list menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to select only the current entry, select Run action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears indicating the incorrect items. they can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog window will appear with the Browse, Simulating and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select the directory merge again / continue or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, a corresponding dialog will appear. then, & kdiff3; continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you click on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not execute them again in the later compilation of all entries. even if the merge operation is skipped or not, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set the Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the elemental tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon; the default is * .cpp; * .h). the default is *.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS too. many self-matically created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set to folder-specific with a .cvsignore file. (refer to info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems a previous point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the elemental tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: when the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links are treated like normal folders and recursively. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in a loop and & kdiff3;) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unsolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are identical. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modified date. please use caution with caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are stored. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file is suggested as action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and receives the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, this will also be deleted without another backup. this also applies to the normal merge of single files, not only merging whole folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the Folder Merge view remains visible during merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can split the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do this, use the Current File Merge function from the Merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory: list -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency by means of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes due to the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then always a file is accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the change date differ from the original. (refer to this option Confidence of Size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently viewed as a Different Viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDef3, press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needs & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a part, & kdiff3; assume that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then, & kdiff3; then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDef3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KON mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDef2 (now it heels Kompare) are already available. furthermore, the name KNO3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identically; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src is sweeping; appeared and the text can't be deleted. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis is confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & Kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use KNO3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the last changes in http: / / kdiff3sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have trouble compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of this.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. inserting (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program, after changes to these options, you have to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will be missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available). if the lines already exist, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, stop them or shift them. this works in both a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops and the applications in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a working area as well as on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu only depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager set up... and Finish. if however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximise, On Desktop and Finish. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes application window to full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field leaves the & Kpager; displays the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled together with name, names are marked with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs are shown as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with their default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classically let & Kpager; in a 2 x N grid, such as from pager applications appear in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical range, which is very good for representation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini programme in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be modified in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then select Set Selection Switches... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently it is not possible to change the settings in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission to the file, you must login as user root or login to your system administrator.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& mousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse-cursor holds a while in the same place. it is thought to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury-Syndrome) and cause pain to any click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer stays in the same place for a while. it is intended to help people who suffer pain in the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). however, it may emulate the dragging with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, because of the pain associated with your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain which is caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all the ergonomic tools, the result may be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & mousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement until the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can run the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; click out a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes is switched on, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is enabled. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function is saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; to shorten the response time, go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the General tab. there's a slide bar Sound Buffer, which you set to lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the level after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which areas a mouse click is left without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse globe.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be quickly clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rollers. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool. if you are using the smart move in this case, this means that you can stop the operation by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you own a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. however, you can use the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to make a keystrokes. secure zones for the mouse are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menu and the titles of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard and insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts; for normal work with & ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is processed in filters before it is sent to speech-scheduler. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace misspoken words or shortcuts, select a suitable language and speaker, or to circumvent specific shortcomings of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the speech-dispatcher program works with a text. & ktops; differentiates four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. if the output of the screen reader is pre-read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg, you can read a long text on a website, you can start with & kmouth; notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you initiate from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & flis; just one such reads, this issue is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String substitute replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; will be supplied with predefined string substitute filters, which enable the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or by e-mail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Speaker Selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text at & ktf; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the tab card speaker, you can read text by KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This displays the list of normal filters. if a filter is not enabled, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed in series from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the below setup dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">If you have found these patterns in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text. case sensitive will not be taken into account when comparing.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the creation column.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">These buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, append the entries from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is used only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is provided with the program qdbus; the & dbus; numbers have to be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID-3432 indicates, you can only enter copying.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replace filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box apply the filter if matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited by delimiters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions. however, if you have installed the & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can refer to it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to compose these expressions; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions find in the package kdeutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. but it can only be applied to well-formed XML. xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Set the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc will suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker Selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker installed on the tab card speaker, or to a speaker with certain features. you can, for example, specify that texts should be read by kmail from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktops; give a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that the program sends to the text on & ktts; sends, and the properties of the speaker set up on the tab card. with the speaker output filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can access it by clicking on the button to get help during input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">In order to achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text complies with the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to view the Speaker Selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your chat settings or delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2679">To compile, to compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later), including packages kdelibs and the software development files for the speech-dispenser program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code of & ktops; from the source code archive for kdeaccessibility or downloaded the tarball that is currently created each night, compile and install the program using the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktops, first check if your speech synthesizer does work with your speech synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of the tool used to integrate speech-scheduler. the kttmsgr utility is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled into individual sentences. the user can go back, repeat the sentence or paragraph (s), pause, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is feminine, it will be used automatically by the best matching speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktops; select a spokesman, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add Spokesman on the Add-on tab, and in order for a speaker to be inserted into the list or click Edit, the index card speaker setup will be displayed. for example, the setup of the Module for Festival Interactive will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is contained in PATH, you will only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the encoding for text that will be passed to the festival. for voices, which & ktts; known, this setting is automatically done. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you set the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and display this gray, the voice you choose will not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forgot to click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed at the start of ktmgr. otherwise, after starting the program window will only be visible in the system segment, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ktmgr does not run, it will appear in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders in the queue are listed, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited set. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the tab card speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2700">Make the speech speed here. 505;% corresponds to about half and 200cm;% approximately twice the normal speech speed. to allow these settings to be implemented, the program must be installed sox.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to apply the new settings for the current & ktops; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you must find out which device works with you. in case of doubt choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktops; handles four types of language records:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. after reading the output of the screen reader, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you're reading a long text on a website, you can come with & mouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning, or issue of a screen reader, adds & ktops; the audio output enters the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are valid for regular text orders only. there are no special actions for messages, alerts and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktops, read KNotify messages, start ktmug and click on notifications.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to activate the reading of & kde; this setting is not selected, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">When this setting is selected, notifications with which a sound is played are by & ktts; not pre-read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events. when you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events specified in the list are ignored by & ktts; ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the desired speaker. default selects the speaker, which is displayed in the list on the list of the speaker as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it is executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as the last option, the action will be applied which was specified under standard (all other events).</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains marks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. SSML is a part of the voiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) because this is the default voice, the festival uses in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limit detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs split text into individual sentences. this allows you to start or stop or stop the first set, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit detection filters. at the first start of & fractts, a set limit detection filter is set automatically as a default. you can change its settings or add more set-limit detection filters, but beginners will not be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to select the speaker by selecting. turn off the speaker selector and enter text for reading. switch on the speaker selection, change some properties and check how the speaker's selection is changed. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then can start faster with reading since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel instructions on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start ttmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit detection filters compare text with a regular expression for set ends and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits. note that the standard set limit detection filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (i.e. notify), alerts, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit detection filter, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>

<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has all the features of a speaker set up. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, & ktts; this speaker out. otherwise, & ktts; the speaker that best matches the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired typing properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Here you can choose the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property has precedence over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker area which best matches the following, click on the default speaker and then click Speaker, which is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it's started. I compiled debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is terminated. if the problem is not resolved by this, you may need to install a non compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text order, freezes & ktts; a. on the & console; appears a message saying: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find clues for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it at festival, but ktmug doesn't show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card reader device. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for conversion from & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML conversion filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktys; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At the festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. therefore, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-tags for converting SSML to Saber-tags. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a set of character cassette filters and now I can go back or forth in & ktops; no more items are displayed on top of the list, but the order consists of one sentence only. what am I doing wrong?</seg>

<seg id="2832">The & knetworkconf homepage; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and others are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, you will find important information about basic network technology, in the second one will discuss all configuration files of & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IPv6 has never found a large distribution of IP networks. IPv6 is expected to break through in the near future. therefore, IPv6 is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in external networks, at & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is available or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.01eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own host). the default route is needed for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if there is a different content in case of active DSL connections.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which moreover offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it has to be integrated by & dat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; revoke the tape and reads the prestressing information of the tape. detects and dat; the pre-tensioning force on the tape does not, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; the pretense, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was incorporated. a corresponding message appears in the status bar. the contents of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; indicated by a change in the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & dat; it must be formatted by & dat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A type of tape must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not conform to formatting in & dat file format. if your tape drive requires formatting before you use it. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, & dat; with the format of the tape proceed. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save As...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens Settings for Backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">The dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item Testing...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the scan was started, the dialog window will appear. in this dialog you can check your selections once again and change the working folder for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">When you confirm the verification settings, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before initializing the restore, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog for Recovery will appear. in this dialog, you can check your selections once again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the recovery settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the tape index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under Backup Files, only the files in it will be backed up on the same file system as the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files have not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmits & dat; before the tape is involved, the load is loaded to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, & dat attempts to suspend the thrust of the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the release of & kdat; automatically ejects the tape. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, you try to change the hardware-like block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. whether this setting is active or not, you need to tell & dat; in any case, you need to tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the machine name is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not an incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for system logs. the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlogue provides experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single log-lines of a log file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will not appear to you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have probably not started with system administrators. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for which normal users usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string. the list of the log rows will now be automatically changed, so that only log rows will be displayed next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, also select another entry. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, select the process column in the log file system log, and report to you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more eye-catching color than protocol lines of the level indicator.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new lines to be added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you can find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following directory of the & kde; Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and so named in the following) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init is quickly becoming the standard for the control of program start-up when you boot up the system in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binaries are under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you want to boot when you boot up the system or when switching to another running level. system services do not include such things like setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something that has to be done with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you come back to fix it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains an K, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server run-level running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevels to launch it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runscales or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. this will only happen if they extract an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sortation number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no possibility to restore records thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another running level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired gulf level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or name of an entry, press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runtime levels, and now the machine is constantly starting new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under running level X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary alignment programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are available from the system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -run level varies from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making changes, you need to save them. either you use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save In File menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog User and Group Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space limitations (quota) for users, a card card is created on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards may appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD bins.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card will appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD bins.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one integrated filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current filesystem is selected by means of the File System with limited space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The management card groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
