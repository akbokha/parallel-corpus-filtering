although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was trapped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona was only ampli@@ fied by my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived in , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you &apos;re and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he tells exactly what he thinks , how a former colleague puts it , and publicly den@@ ies his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless people have re@@ acted to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he gained in the Republi@@ can election was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ad@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ad@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lem@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values incar@@ n@@ ated through them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
while Tr@@ ump drew his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of them know , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ its the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : so much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revol@@ t of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; white and whi@@ plas@@ h word game , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trauma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the great Van Jones ter@@ med , exactly what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have , America is welcome everybody .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , would nowhere else be possible in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a vast majority of the white America of America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would someone not like you have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for whom his son fell sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t let their love for music spoil by garbage
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ ger ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and the gang violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day by day trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically on top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made up of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of waste .
the repertoire encompasses classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local e@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music round the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to take one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries whom you simply refused to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , rec@@ alls . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia for pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network , besides Somalia and Madagascar , are the six countries that at that time had exp@@ elled the PM from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also very atten@@ tively follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data .
this makes it possible for authorities to identify ships that go fishing in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship is inviting its caught fish to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the go and if they have a criminal justice .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships at their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated $ 20 million in lost sales , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year due to the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
their practices include sailing under false flag , fake ro@@ y@@ alties , imag@@ inations , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fully organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not run my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is now trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks distributed by counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found volati@@ le vessels .
due to his co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal vessels that they like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered from satellites .
this is why Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . at the same time , F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal alli@@ ed ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Protection Organization : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed anywhere in the world by means of the position of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing , it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project allowing a global system to prosec@@ ute ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously had no license and had scar@@ c@@ ely had consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now account for a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats have bought more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors came on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use was prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries have joined forces in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; Safety is the aim of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October , it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is continuing to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela refused the opposition &apos;s request to a referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans ret@@ ali@@ ated , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by getting together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the refund of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central North @-@ situated Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; however , the reluc@@ tance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( for example : round Table of Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for the majority of representatives of the opposition in 2015 .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday coun@@ try@@ wide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most often shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse , are pil@@ ing up on Twitter .
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators pulled back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round which de@@ forms the degree of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures have been fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !

others see these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little action against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and preferred to refra@@ in from critic@@ ising critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news site .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cor@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba .
in the trial that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
records of the archive .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , accused of ab@@ duction in 158 counts , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP systems .
be careful not to kidn@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army , the military arm of Argentina &apos;s Revolutionary Workers Party .
that &apos;s why he allowed me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers which had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

the prisoners are tor@@ tured over there &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks where cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just anything - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I se@@ w@@ ed in and saw a song that people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied up there .
they in@@ frequently attached a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell right away and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eye pads .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay facing down with the face - they were all tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people slept quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms called offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero ham@@ pered and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , tried to death the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path you entered here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived tor@@ turing , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be la@@ ied .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &quot; boot@@ y &quot;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen stuff .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military characters , which one takes away from an enemy that one has fought .

but when one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , record players , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , it is not a spo@@ ils of war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you who steal cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
this is how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle jum@@ per from wool .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to his home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ at@@ ant in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can put my burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to cancel .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last &apos; h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so , during the dictatorship , you have executed people , but what the cor@@ p@@ ses van@@ ish ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought home a girl whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked the question again and again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into jail .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but what their bodies would disappear ?
did these people not even have families to hand over their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were mill@@ ed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there &apos;s always something left .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I gave him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I saw how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 , I paid the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 Supp@@ lies were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court handed down sentences of life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ sty : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military members , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the secret chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have been working on justice for the victims for many years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research for it lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial to be set up by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terri@@ fying mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , in which one can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , witnessed a very un@@ fortunate translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was wrong@@ ly mistaken - possibly but also with evil thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terri@@ fying mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appears in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could this English translation come ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not entirely correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture did not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News explained a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents in the country is quite a reason to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , the Senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this enabled her share to rise to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the named repor@@ ter published comments on the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently rebel against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo with the translation error has , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So flaw@@ ed is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , one needs two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as a native language to translate the translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost or relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
nevertheless , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ose and pu@@ zz@@ ling pro@@ positions that arise from mechanical translations show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including pu@@ zz@@ ling im@@ prints , often ad@@ orn T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry , but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more dili@@ gent translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
website of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would not have access to the online broad@@ ca@@ ster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
other users later wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters also recorded recordings of the Car@@ ac@@ as protests organised by opposition groups who opposed the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cli@@ pped and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Zen@@ it : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ s@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was not accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
earlier research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly .
if a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds flaw@@ ed or denied the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday 6th April when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who recorded the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was taken into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves in order to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ mean child as a child . now she is visiting the house in which she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mean tas , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ mean for the family . as Cri@@ mean , one design@@ ates the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must spend countless days of house@@ work , which is never paid and can be victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be cancelled .
the practice described as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of both boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , for the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ mean is generally silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the belief that she can complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of itself , &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes the girl with her and justi@@ fies her exploitation with faith , is to give someone a chance that would otherwise not be educated and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent be@@ atings . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ mean in the household of the former military man Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as an officer at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra attacked Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s deep @-@ rooted practice for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go will come to court .
the life of a Cri@@ mean
the Cri@@ mean tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Cri@@ mean .
in her employer &apos;s house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also did not get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often allowed me to visit my family because they believed that I would learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord fear@@ ing that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose , she explains .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .

because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ mean .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or neighborhood .

in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning personnel and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .

hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven year old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the homeland that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors of the display switched off once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .

bill introduces Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations governing the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is accepted by parliament , users of social media must be registered with a government authority in Egypt to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the T@@ elecommunic@@ ations Ministry to enter the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to it , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technologi@@ ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , an Egyptian initiative for personal rights ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , this means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens that request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor human activities and also to bring them to a court case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative body of Parliament and the constitutional committees before going into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and should be ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the picture surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was envis@@ aged for those found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold has been published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights campaig@@ ner H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian Leopard .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see an Persian Leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video finds that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera trap R@@ aza breaks out in sheer joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza pursu@@ es passion@@ ately a different side of her country , which is not only made up of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the North @-@ East of Japan , documented the progress made in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; three @-@ fold catastrophe &quot; in March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was an important pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to escape because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal cities from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has not yet experienced a nuclear accident , alone for that reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of those affected by themselves .
the housing complex in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( which were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) were completed by December 2015 .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the final light .
at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from house shel@@ ters ( as for example , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) are still trying to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36@@ ,000 people living in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 are still living in shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of ev@@ acu@@ ees breath@@ ed in homes after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , this figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by the disaster have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have severely affected the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agriculture in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have been destroyed in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still lag@@ ged far behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feelings about the ts@@ un@@ ami risk changed .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed find that it has not been done enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue marking the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung increasingly focused on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses .
as of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old . they are well known for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger at first than the common ground .
however , after a while , one often recognizes that one is more connected than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .

the Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia took him with a strike against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march around the country .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers how he hits Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on TV for six months and the entire suppression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s hur@@ ried to him shortly afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10.000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been repeatedly divided into social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , only to crimin@@ alise the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group had been killed , and here we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stab in his face .
police interference
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which there were brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators set up a stage for speakers .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via speaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media broad@@ cast@@ ed street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window washer .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window in order to design their titles in an illustr@@ ative way with a photo .
on the other hand O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered with head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ aten@@ ation in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba included the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the national community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site .
it &apos;s been two years since the activities were l@@ ame in the sugar cane factories .
after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories which are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back into operation because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls perfectly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests have already been no news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound has to remain , according to the 2016 published report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Nutrition Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane plant Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first shooting year , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of official written documents which would differ only in terms of the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was over@@ taken and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the de@@ func@@ t factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane production still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed he disman@@ tled one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial zone of Cuba and the most important work counter@@ parts was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of those present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high by milling .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane plant closed , or better said , when they began to remove it , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms as well .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects , many young people left the region once again .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ trac@@ table person , yet he does not forgive the lies you told him .
they have been tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to reti@@ re at age 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter .

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this through Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop band The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop begins with the participation of young participants in discussions on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka State University .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ aro@@ qui@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of road in Western Canada , where almost two dozen indigenous women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influence of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the teenagers don &apos;t always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ ma@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the stan@@ chi@@ on is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel as if no one ever is interested in me
but I still try to go on Earth for my days
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that one day we will rise up
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead with our youth
so they can do what the Creator has appointed for .
in the commentary volume , the reader and author of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to Sil@@ en@@ cio ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of every dish served in this restaurant .
customers view these plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic dishes .
in the To@@ gu neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are many small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend revers@@ es them today in striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ omas the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic trays , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food adjustments is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
this part was also produced for the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
some cell phone stands and mobile phone designers will allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or nit@@ rous oxide is used , a popular opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
for more whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes you can watch under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and the killed regularly appear only in stat@@ s . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely repres@@ sed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or on the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone discovered in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico founded the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ing a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between law enforcement and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico disc@@ usses the project like this :
organised crime not only allows us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Fear Chang@@ ed Life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret graves for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we again prepare ourselves for the task that we have asked to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my son is the name of Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he was supposed to be back , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me too .
at the moment , it does not have any income .
you stand for my father &apos;s insurance , but she doesn &apos;t get paid off because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ iting a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to show only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter in what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I pass by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different , or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to be Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified , that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to argue that they are spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the capital district : how a family with threats was pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals pe@@ aked monthly for month from their business until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma is left , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Kids of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation Desig@@ ned by Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he talks about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had gone by two years before , when he had just removed a few blocks from his home , saw the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was like :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizens council for public safety and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 million per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the country &apos;s soul .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ating a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial release it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant pain@@ st@@ aking reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es , which were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the ambul@@ ance fell victim to it .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , full of people watching the World Cup .
houses were scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people watch them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo was taken on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms several times and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses have reported dras@@ tically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only by satellite images the follow @-@ up period could be illustrated .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the potential scale of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments like this mistakenly counter@@ f@@ eit the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning strike , published by the United Nations describes those who could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that the President of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the picture from the DR Congo to depic@@ t this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies which called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an being this statement , but had not associated the picture of the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) .
they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have identified examples of impro@@ per use and linked it to the respective countries on which side they were published . by doing so , we want to portra@@ y the reach more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use can originate from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked to each other ) .
here are some cases which can now be fully detected ( on the orange card ) :
map : News frames .
country Ex@@ am@@ ples of false coupling of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods .
the Gra@@ y countries are examples that , according to the met@@ a data and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

in this article about explo@@ sions in Northern Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .

France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ bit@@ es after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster refu@@ te this .

even in Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was seen as evidence of the bom@@ bing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government issued a correction on what to do as &quot; intentionally dark@@ ened news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which was published exclusively in English , also contains references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to the members of the Orthodox Church , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims trying to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar said Th@@ ein Sein 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture remains in it at the time of this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near @-@ standing news page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture came into circulation later in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te the fact that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ fertilizer y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed to take place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ old ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( German ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums like this were published here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false .
from the message containing the picture from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ ine@@ ers Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ ting also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Musli@@ men . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original review of 2010 , the image might ultimately have a correct description , but the original article is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence linked to the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life are both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are ei@@ ghty people who inad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and humili@@ ates the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that stopping images from a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is concern that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers , and the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss in the news media about violent represent@@ ations , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used intentionally from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international it can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog named un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. un@@ enfor@@ ce@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from all over the world , which are difficult or impossible to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish Sob@@ ot@@ esa ) .
but they all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online @-@ list for quite a while .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ at@@ u &apos;s Ta@@ xes , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - worry about your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik Spe@@ ech spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are very much appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite audi@@ tors here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is affected by the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ c@@ ely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud av@@ al@@ an@@ ches .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe residen@@ ces .
the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the has@@ h tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Gulf crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ us@@ wa Bus was standing in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle was also flooded due to the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are being made to transport emergency supplies to residents en@@ rolled in their flooded villages .
various organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ y@@ ya and Him@@ ar@@ ana .
please call us today number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this field .
the taxi @-@ call App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of safety and provide help .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend .
I entr@@ ust to her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me to her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next we call rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ ru@@ ci@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me , don &apos;t fit into it , are det@@ ri@@ mental .
to be dis@@ cour@@ aged
I don &apos;t stand alone with it .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception , Rum@@ i &apos;s religion was er@@ ased , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist ima@@ gery of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing idi@@ om is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ es the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures are further prot@@ esting today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to understand it .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed nar@@ rations dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US did not even have to choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is evident that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and flaw@@ ed our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , of religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to which 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population is African @-@ ethnic Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at the time when Khan imag@@ ines the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unavoid@@ able Muslims and Americans .
but am I now irre@@ voc@@ ably a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket warri@@ or , which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect of Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all the ash@@ trays with us .
we do not have to be a the@@ ological expert in order to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information that have manipul@@ ated our already flaw@@ ed image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the United States , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it acc@@ esses our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain that .
I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslims when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all @-@ ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter , if I was silent in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses for protection that seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and are called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on my mother@@ ly side with her sisters ; how she has been winning a competition for the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the picture of her that at this moment I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be a Muslim means to speak the prayers which she told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people who - over centuries - was col@@ oni@@ zed by an Empire , which a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable British East Coast Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men are not crying , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan ham@@ pered to his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family owned by India , which he was not allowed to close in half a century into his arms .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be a Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , cas@@ h@@ mere sub@@ subject of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , because he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy eng@@ ages the US and the suspect has a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pakistan woman , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
being a mother means taking care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals er@@ ect on this ambig@@ u@@ ity structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registri@@ es which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars we conduct and the bombs that we throw off on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically wrong image and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations We Have to Con@@ duct
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply concerned to de@@ magne@@ ti@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous pic@@ torial print@@ outs that we ste@@ er in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square over black American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they grew expon@@ enti@@ ally because they made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate big areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old as it is now my daughter , but who have made me an ir@@ repres@@ sible Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other hand of the Berkeley bridge , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place in the course of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

but these are not words that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why I &apos;m telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being w@@ aged and people are being en@@ chan@@ ted by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , was even scientist of Stan@@ ford about four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I imagine a new future in which we have no president who is bombar@@ ding chocolate cake , going far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now , in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of language of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been performing events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the feasibility of the project :
the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that adopt diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
while listening is often associated with understanding &quot; these events &quot; instead &quot; listen to listening in order to appreciate , to make sense . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their history in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and representation make it possible for the audience to act accordingly .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ata also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to extend it . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico demand re @-@ setting of public debt from the US
with the aim of a re @-@ audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march started at the Mexican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
she was proclaimed by the French group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural audit of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ inde@@ bt@@ edness of the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a leadership committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed salary that operates in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - the sovereign territory of the United States , which is not integrated into the state alliance , is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law of state responsibility as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration called the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; had taken Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; order of the Military Tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who pres@@ ided over the Assad administration on 12 November 2015 and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototype was more pres@@ cient than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would do everything to em@@ body this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smart phones .
he brought me the internet .
he taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ ggles the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is freely available .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink into the world of your lovely eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace
that every one of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guar@@ dians
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I &apos;ll go into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tille &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests in 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 according to the International Human Rights Organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption , Director of prison sentenced to provisional posts after prison
Moz@@ ambique responded with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants for disp@@ ers@@ al of 54 million people .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose council was the member of the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately demanded his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the motion , there was no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants are not called the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
the company apparently remained silent and had no adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil , says the director doesn &apos;t have any moral morality :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so mas@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing mor@@ als and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , who will not only remember the Moz@@ ambique as the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic say@@ ings .
one of his most famous oral presentations was when he firmly affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and was free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and today the company , at which he sp@@ ends money , sets him back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ w _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo of the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( in German : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Moz@@ ambique :

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users too wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or fis@@ sur@@ es .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network adopted their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook has cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; al @-@ to @-@ the @-@ point &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ atory conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt about their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same alphab@@ et sequence as &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , a chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet thinks that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before del@@ aying all posts that are suspected of being rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm won &apos;t understand what you are writing on Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words next to it .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who promote hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to print , post and share content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his views on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which did not contain hate speech but were still removed :
used with approval .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads , &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and look at an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is intended to inc@@ ite violence in the commun@@ es of Myanmar in particular , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to control the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code @-@ concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago &apos;s end with the to@@ e deer
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now 18 .
in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Child &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined by every person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who had already been married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media moves that endeav@@ ored to aboli@@ sh children &apos;s marriage laws followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition arous@@ ed tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
yet at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook that Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the Bill against Child Comm@@ ons was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on to@@ dd@@ lers were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was minist@@ ering a ministry of ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ured the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to aboli@@ sh practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states , &quot; Out@@ standing news !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law of marriage has been decided . &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age @-@ old age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the change of marriage was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all the de@@ pu@@ ties voted against have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # showed child@@ care signs .
many thanks to all the activists who fought for him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook is coming in the form of Sat Guru , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj proc@@ laim@@ s his intention to take legal steps , should the law be adopted and he seems to dissolve his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , advoc@@ ate of the law , said that unless Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patri@@ cia Vor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply say that the state , our daughters , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court proceeding against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit it .

on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content .
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using reverse tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform laid down all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is in spite of legal prohibition , however , irre@@ voc@@ able .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on distributed and distributed ways .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when the respective country Wikipedia is locked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and employee of mo@@ z@@ illa at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server will forward the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motives and well @-@ balanced colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just arrived at home when suddenly he called me ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to gn@@ ash pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to attain worldwide recognition of Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood up to tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ ov@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ released here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , it avoids women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should ignore the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was condemned by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name .
the tradition of not nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have much less assignment to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he , in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city &apos;s main topic .
it is a place only for them , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to uncover practices such as children &apos;s marriage right up to the marriage of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and heads these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was of women who do not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not speaking al@@ oud to the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her name , wanted to try out at home as it is .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a century @-@ old tradition in which married women are never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she only ch@@ oked before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that indicates the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ now@@ ledge run if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped doing so , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months , for the first time in their life they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to tell certain things , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ eh Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , morality linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini adorned their own couple of c@@ rit@@ os ( shirts ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will make it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly rolling :
so far we have only done little steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then again stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear vermi@@ lion on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as viol@@ ets for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice made by the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the Beat@@ les &apos; visit in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the post @-@ war Japanese culture .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here soon realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les first came to Japan in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; says Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les Day is a memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places related to the band .
as you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York State Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les Day is a memorial day .
it was exactly this year that the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base in the market , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going on .
so , we hope you &apos;re there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia police warned the people that gl@@ are @-@ headed men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald men for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for dis@@ continued purposes , worries the Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia police , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man of bald man could contain or bring gold , the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on men of bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who would like to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique to Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bur@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are implic@@ ated in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ r@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head would have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a told on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Moz@@ ambique is facing :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE My@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT I am ashamed of a country where people would be ashamed to ask for sex against good marks , a country where people would not hurt honest pursu@@ its or even take their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald can be hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and thri@@ lled Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ r@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ere , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murdered people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ ze Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winner and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably done recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after taking part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to release views from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to permit him to be treated abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . Norway signed an agreement only in June to resume salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed its hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she announced in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA - USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would like him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , insofar as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy &apos;s invitation drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to un@@ condi@@ tionally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany - Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8 .
prior to that , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate health care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s attorney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those imper@@ vious to the exercise of these rights .
France - France
in an explanation on 29 June , the Foreign Office of France called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually accept it .
Taiwan Manufacturer and Supplier
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of mainland matters in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to let itself be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 , who stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly as Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ tive : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries . &quot; in view of this , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , aband@@ oning the distorted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
he offered relevant questions in a rational manner with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
as An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
please read the tran@@ script .
when he said Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ easy , even if we enjoy free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said to Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - be I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that , right associates and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review disc@@ usses the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay back ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
according to the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade on Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , Journey of a Dec@@ ade was and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many Singap@@ ura ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , revealing news about certain parts of the world and showing a different fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series is by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook internally before anger when they are kept for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differ from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried tiny map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would mistake me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means to be sp@@ ook@@ y - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , soft but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has a Canadian dual @-@ tran@@ sit@@ ory ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward , but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; doesn &apos;t have personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and paying no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence along the fence .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that is par@@ o@@ ding the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized the power and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend does .
although not explicitly political , the music video still refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video about the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video loaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it relates to the situation of the country under the rule of Jun@@ ta .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Change of imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above illustrates the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosec@@ ute people who were accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand uses a strict mali@@ ce against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maj@@ estic Viol@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut &quot; The Tri@@ bute to Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the post @-@ war society takes up only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Persian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ p@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ pel@@ vis of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eur@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sides in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , but today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , symboli@@ se the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings have fallen into decay and rarely are they inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ov@@ ka , which houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district office supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will always stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says .
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for each child , Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 child @-@ money .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball rolling .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for lack of livel@@ iness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19th April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and published here with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectac@@ les frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the names Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , tells Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you from Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have been sleeping outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , she bu@@ ys medicines they cannot pay , she massages them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao is travelling with his sister hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the circuit and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report to her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their little house .
it is polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his office .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other people also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single teacher , offered him its roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to take .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travellers consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she &apos;s browsing through her album with a lot of photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification to instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
in the communication of the police , the app informed the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages on digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit dis@@ satisfaction and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app .
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert asked people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ demo@@ s China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( P@@ Is ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description which shows that the software can up@@ lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the direction of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office upon operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued an order to allow all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qui &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a whole number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; S@@ leep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and imagine that you are alone in a place where everything important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible from within as well as from outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that makes all honor to her name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the scene , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are imprisoned here between the walls that your parents have , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough so I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
during a peaceful protest , five teenagers were torn away from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all quarters of the town cov@@ eted , but not my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city which is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down a little after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me . we alli@@ ed to a magnificent image that completely fulfilled my expectations .
at such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ a@@ geous enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re really sorry to see me in your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so certain to my case when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in my nose until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months of imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I passed through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details carefully before I enter the room .
otherwise they have assigned me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner and can sit down immediately without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old method of communication : beating the fist up against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ resp@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be recognized by me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps it will be heard right away .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ored on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from a distance I still hear them cry &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es are heard , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of ruin until I saw the yellow light which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view .
this is not a house , which is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he comes to me like that .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that gli@@ de away : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ vines and protest in demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to not reply .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had nothing done to make this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your crying .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with it , and you cannot hold back your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so that they exchanged the pipe with a cable .
at my first arrest I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a waste collector sooner or if that was part of the normal work equipment .
they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice too , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he picked up an electrically loaded rod next to him .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarters .
my half @-@ naked body , stretching out on the floor , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you will be mis@@ placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about LG@@ BT@@ Q + community rights , freedom of speech and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he s@@ nar@@ es to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ lows ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with issues such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to Yemen in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by borders in his thinking , and he can feel his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version to the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a human , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in water , Nes@@ cafÃ© po@@ urs in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the slu@@ gs speak of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you take a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink water in the public during Ram@@ adan , in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan canc@@ eled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Camp@@ a@@ ign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ai , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the band &apos;s engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free speech in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism which asks the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an ever @-@ clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b advanced traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; Ehren@@ mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 , but even more difficult is Jordan &apos;s lack of institutional infrastructure to support women who have become victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 criminal off@@ ence law , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence must &quot; in@@ definitely be imprisoned in prison &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not do anything .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music is also very popular and is known not to shy away from issues that were considered tab@@ oo in his country for a long time .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot divor@@ ce his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have been sof@@ tened by politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically at the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song , a verse repeatedly repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what one wants &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a modified version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ys , a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory thanks to his hom@@ opho@@ bic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ ys , who was supposed to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service had arrested several former government officials and members of the Association of Te@@ ach@@ ers on the grounds that they had cri@@ tically comments on comments in social media about the problems deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has fought M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s what H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial ways of developing demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and , consequently , resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many parts of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the stron@@ gh@@ olds , drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from western Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region to push the em@@ iss@@ ism into their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to get some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed @-@ cars are just to be seen .
but for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and in addition a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ u@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a mast of 18 meters was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

outer appearances and body care were rarely as important as in this story , because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of the crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser &apos;s .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trade are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 .
experts face each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric look , as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current cont@@ ests can be found on the public Facebook profile of Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young@@ sters have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love with the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ bitions on guer@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve released . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel ex@@ cre@@ ted to accommodate affection ?
this question did not leave the young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ a and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la Col@@ li@@ aci@@ Ã³n campaign , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their share : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement of F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before the Colom@@ bi@@ ologists , however , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal refugee camps for many years have been subjected to a war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into their lives as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred for guer@@ ri@@ lla struggles , must now enter its ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must unite and help the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla war , which should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation began at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share with people this year to share his love with people who needed most urgently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ al , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ I never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything between them , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a co @-@ worker of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in because next to him on the bed was an M@@ GL shell , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
to kick off , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a round of discussion .
the students were all grown up when there was war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC have explained the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State had spread to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can contribute to shaping society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
for example , Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , Archbishop of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bian was prophesi@@ ed that after the dis@@ armament there would be peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms , to rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who are defending life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ h@@ ova and whose first publication took place on the website of OC Media .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ compl@@ aining about the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not been created overnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports were published that addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ os@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested some suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in gun @-@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ national woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group had experienced Ch@@ ech@@ ens of the gender equality of their rural woman , the ch@@ ase was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the US in the final end .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eradic@@ ate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the lap .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just trying to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honour the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything along and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in which the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it , but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having respect with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a plate with 95 seats stood under the window .
after it happened the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was tra@@ cked .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering , without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;d be safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had locked me in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut up a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
that is what I mean , they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine told me that there were not so many .
if , above all , those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to the court of Kad@@ y@@ rov .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m just quot@@ ing someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken away .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports about it . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in the ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Safety of the Sh@@ aria has never even cur@@ bed a hair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yeah .
they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how the people in the city started to change .
those who were laugh@@ ing and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I returned home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ating .
OC Media : what action are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ aps , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I cleared away places of escape .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
it is nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to show you foam in front of your mouth that there are no coils .
the stan@@ chi@@ ons have what the cab@@ ard@@ ins have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know many think about transitions in men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to feel ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August with@@ drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , according to Ah@@ ra@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video , split onto YouTube , held the moments after he lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority in August , and activists in the area warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights declared that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to pursue their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy acquired power and in 1925 much effort was undertaken to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s to diver@@ t water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ts@@ men rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who seek a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ med human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic patterns emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and for@@ cing them to earn their living out of their native country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing arab@@ ic clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the site of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put forth well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we ought to be all femin@@ ist in general .
for instance , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and well known to me .
I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to talk on skin color , on black C@@ is women , on black women in LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and home towns earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all the women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which relate to both the sex and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; jour@@ ne@@ y@@ men compl@@ ained in their speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and sex , as some of them will continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : claims ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we re@@ conquer ourselves ) says that we can defend ourselves in this way also spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists instantly call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , please let me know about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
this article will be published again within the scope of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has travelled extensively over the past seven years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern from Kur@@ dist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; relates Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ turally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , who reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people affected .
a Police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent to her .
since the end of their relationship some time has gone by and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena on account of abuse , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not profit anything .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make a refund at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to prosecution authorities at all .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statistics 2 Un@@ visible abuse and a legal system that is nothing sub@@ mer@@ sible 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate conversion be@@ atings and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studio , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence took place at District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence at the peace courts . 86 % of women were reported here as well .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated ; 55 % of women were talking about mental abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offen@@ se , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed by their current or former partners each year .
until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , a woman died every ten days in Paraguay because of violence done by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but after that she was still looking for it . this should be regre@@ t@@ table for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognis@@ able :
I would never have thought that I would become victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women have happened that are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and related how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed the so long Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ Wen@@ ders ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original design of the law stipul@@ ates that a perpet@@ ual criminal off@@ ence is to be declared and tough@@ er as it is already the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the law was changed in a number of ways in order to also gain de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had fores@@ een that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence have to bear at the present time , if they just wanted to report ad and receive secure accommodation , would impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be a change in mind so that violence is no longer seen as something normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever remains silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of offen@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to make a full refund until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate was passed . prior to that , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was canc@@ eled , which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a major set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media continues to attack attacks in Oman one year after the bann@@ ing of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed because of a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Ottom@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later returned .
Oman has been in power since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had defeated his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the insist@@ ent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and incar@@ cer@@ ating human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically obstruc@@ t peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since it was founded in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after publishing an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties in the hands of justice &quot; on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS before the Special Repres@@ entative and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS received the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at on 26 September 2016 .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted , inter alia , for the dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 anom@@ ali@@ es ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year ban on occupational disability was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after being found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of $ 5000 was fixed ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the verdict was announced .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Roman@@ ic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister presented himself once again against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to allow the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren &apos;t the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of print on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , calls on the authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their right human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf Region and neighbouring states through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , peac@@ efully , and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far @-@ reaching effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be con@@ duci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic demonstrated the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently lies the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently working on a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipients instead of being a mach@@ er .
the solutions we get are often not good in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where is funding and support coming from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
what barriers are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how large is in your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for specialized scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of living as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines cover articles only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ Wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change world food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com &apos;s website , a magazine about solutions to environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding Sal@@ ad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but in the early 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding .
the patents are not only valid for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton always breeds Sal@@ ad , but meanwhile he needs longer , since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to catch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , nobody can breed a new type of salad , because all the features have already been patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
it has also joined a movement growing in the US and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red red@@ dish let@@ tu@@ ce of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source seed initiative ( initiative for open source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , called briefly O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue doing business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and not immediately sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding prospects
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Board Member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds therefore play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmer &apos;s rights , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is com@@ promised , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , deals with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability in her doctoral thesis . she found that about one third of all cart@@ el features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant bree@@ ders to be har@@ ness@@ ed either at all .
such estimates do not yet exist for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale plants such as wheat can be patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four genetic banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property limits other bree@@ ders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ vari@@ et@@ ate innovations support innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing the public with more material and expertise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees that different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops adapted to changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to be : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders do not have time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant tra@@ its : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form themselves and as bree@@ ders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US State Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation are required mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that operate in international markets , but are smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , most smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I work with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company that patented .
I always need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years from competition , which makes it very easy to do in my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
although the USA seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the centre is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that fulfill certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also helps them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ ements is working on an open @-@ source licence , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i commitment cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
one explanation , however , is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems , which should be the official starting signal for the planned next year .
a consortium of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policies to ensure stable food supply .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still ban content on the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ Y@@ I ) , which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world , and reports on them .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains un@@ le@@ ashed in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities which should actually defend the law , to pass on freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now . AN@@ TO@@ O confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to im@@ part . we ins@@ ist on further fulfilling our task .
HR@@ I is the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ derived network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation has fallen victim to the wave of web page blocking . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
apart from AN@@ DR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher , Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , has no access to Egypt anymore .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which also Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog is given a home , is still available .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s block@@ age and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They succeeded in conveying to me the feeling of a state of siege ; An arrest , a attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons to the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web page I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words : my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now , after locking him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ a@@ geous enter the road to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked off from 24 May to 6 August 133 web@@ pages . this resulted in technical testing in the networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of providers , through the transfer of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the locking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will it next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army is in operation at the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

newspapers in Brazil are reporting day after day with glo@@ omy head@@ lines in Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every other day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , nav@@ y and air lake to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that happens by civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry out : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to ret@@ ou@@ ch atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is justi@@ fiable .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public service .
in memory : Rio de Janeiro State is larger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per federal state , Rio is on number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia pointed out , has been repe@@ ating the state security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police fund and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor municipalities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police cleared up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : trained Syrians to learn to plant fung@@ i
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons attacked the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 , is particularly affected .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these areas have been besieg@@ ed by rebels in controlled areas outside Damascus , which resulted in inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and check@@ points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own fung@@ us as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the traditional foods that are planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to post this project and express its relief that it is becoming more and more known . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of the cultivation of mushrooms , as Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shor@@ tages , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and , if they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger bath tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
dis@@ semin@@ ate a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( like paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for obtaining new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and that we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ mp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and around 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government to exc@@ el in solidarity with the victims last week for three days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded by fires .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of testim@@ onies of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the shape of the forest adopted by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor allowing everything to be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co .
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to the fires of this species .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when people sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it uses the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires .

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , was getting closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his small wage , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar which were heavier than himself to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we also worked .
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ qi came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ qi homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high number of pregn@@ an@@ cies , but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum , which can withdraw after the registration of the asylum application for months .
until then people who do not have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
that &apos;s how it came to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his ir@@ repres@@ sible life @-@ wil@@ le helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions very soon .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ qi made his entire savings to the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies in Afghanistan have ar@@ isen , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant ori@@ ent experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail and aim back to the country he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their crop yields on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development to a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity remain .
A@@ shar@@ qi has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along this path .
N@@ eti@@ ze report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt allow the dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ y &apos;s N@@ eti@@ ze Report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the removal of a sentence .
the law , which has been applied by sixty Members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another Member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal to introduce harder pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a senior official .
under the law proposal , however , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who captured Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the im@@ pe@@ achment of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in prison for a court appointment with more than 700 participants who had been arrested by the same incident .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to May 20 , because according to human rights groups , the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent load of among others weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iz@@ a spoke to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists arrested le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , expressly supported a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption charges official am@@ ne@@ sty , provided they return all un@@ lawful received funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April sheds light on the presentation of the presidential plans to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the appointment of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
does China want to force users of social media to present their identity ?
according to new regulations of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the provisions , it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts suspect that this will mean the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizens &quot; journ@@ alism and independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the provincial government as an &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law that provides the Russian government with a list of online services that make the &quot; release of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make ob@@ dur@@ ate services for the removal of content and to force it on request for the execution of user data .
these websites include websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ vice Ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has block@@ age Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the block@@ ade Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications stated that the site was blocked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source co@@ operating with groups to fom@@ ent a political diff@@ rent campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website , including China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet Service Provi@@ ders to monitor communication in real time and to install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunic@@ ation companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation is still ongoing until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
