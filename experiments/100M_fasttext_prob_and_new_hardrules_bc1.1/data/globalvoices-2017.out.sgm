<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous plot of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method Man," "" "it was like the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona was only amplified by my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I've ever lived in, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you're and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, how a former colleague puts it, and publicly denies his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have reacted to his statements and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he gained in the Republican election was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Trumps" "" "Weltanschauung" "" "did not agree with Peter Bhada, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhada and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Lemey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values incarnated through them deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump drew his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of them know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commits the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "" ": so much like" "" "revolt of the whites against all other ethnicities" "" "; white and whiplash word game, which means" "" "trauma" "", "as the great Van Jones termed, exactly what America has done so splendidly." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have, America is welcome everybody.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, would nowhere else be possible in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a vast majority of the white America of America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would someone not like you have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for whom his son fell sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the Province of Oaxaca in common with the children of the Paraguayan city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now La banda de MÃºsica (music banger) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and the gang violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day by day trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located practically on top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made up of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violin, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local eologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music round the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to take one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries whom you simply refused to do," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority, recalls. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia for pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network, besides Somalia and Madagascar, are the six countries that at that time had expelled the PM from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can damage the illegal fishing ecosystems which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail empo, with the information circulated between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also very attentively follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for authorities to identify ships that go fishing in forbidden areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship is inviting its caught fish to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the go and if they have a criminal justice.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships at their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated $20 million in lost sales, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year due to the illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, fake royalties, imaginations, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-fully organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "previously, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You may not run my port" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole is now trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks distributed by counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found volatile vessels.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his co-operation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal vessels that they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "" "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">This is why Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. at the same time, FISH-i will help to find criminal allied ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet, FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed anywhere in the world by means of the position of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing, it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project allowing a global system to prosecute ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously had no license and had scarcely had consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now account for a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats have bought more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors came on board towing nets, whose use was prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are an object of study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined forces in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "Safety is the aim of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October, it presented Greko 1, a ship under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">Road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the impeachment of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela refused the opposition's request to a referendum on the impeachment, the Venezuelans retaliated, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emptiness by getting together on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the refund of Venezuela), both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also carried out in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central North-situated Bundestag Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the impeachment of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; however, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum on impeachment was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (for example: round Table of Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called for the majority of representatives of the opposition in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that talk about confrontations, as well as reports of repression and abuse, are piling up on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators pulled back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean state of TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many national gardeners do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round which deforms the degree of oppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentine news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torture and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Records of the archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, accused of abduction in 158 counts, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>

<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have become friends with one of the ERP systems.</seg>
<seg id="221">Be careful not to kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army, the military arm of Argentina's Revolutionary Workers Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">That's why he allowed me to go back to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers which had belonged to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me for the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks where cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just anything - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a song that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a cot and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They infrequently attached a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and hunted him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell right away and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound with handcuffs and were wearing eye pads.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men lay facing down with the face - they were all tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance, people slept quietly on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torturing, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be laied.</seg>

<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was at the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - I realized that war booty is a bayonet or perhaps military characters, which one takes away from an enemy that one has fought.</seg>

<seg id="273">But when one goes into a house and steals the refrigerator, record players, clothes, paintings, money... steals, it is not a spoils of war, but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer with the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I answered: and you who steal cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded in rage, struck me and screamed:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, I will find you and kill you.</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes to his home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me of being a conspiratant in this crime. I answered, no problem, they can put my burden on what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway, I was there to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the corpse is the last 'heinous act'</seg>

<seg id="295">Well, so, during the dictatorship, you have executed people, but what the corpses vanish?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day, my father brought home a girl whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I asked the question again and again: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply put them into jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was just decided to kill these people, but what their bodies would disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families to hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act that one can do to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was reintroduced, they fetched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving licence, witnessed a very unfortunate translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "on a sign the Japanese word" "" "old motorists" "" "was wrongly mistaken - possibly but also with evil thoughts & # 8212; translated as" "" "terrifying motorists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The incorrect translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which was often shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which appears in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could this English translation come?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture did not apologize for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are very sorry that older people felt offended by the inadequate correction of our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "fearful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents in the country is quite a reason to worry." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, one needs two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as a native language to translate the translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost or relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Nevertheless, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbose and puzzling propositions that arise from mechanical translations show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including puzzling imprints, often adorn T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry, but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more diligent translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the Internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Website of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they would not have access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also recorded recordings of the Caracas protests organised by opposition groups who opposed the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was clipped and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenit: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among dental veneers with internet access, especially in times of turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was not accessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS) but also two other online transmitters. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web page is blocked by the DNS, the server responds flawed or denied the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was suspended on Thursday 6th April when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who recorded the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes it more difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a Crimean child as a child. now she is visiting the house in which she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today, Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testimonies from other Crimean tas, who became victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and re-released by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which something has become," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old she began to work as a Crimean for the family. as Crimean, one designates the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or their underage daughter to another richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children must spend countless days of housework, which is never paid and can be victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice described as criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of both boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, for the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Crimean is generally silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in the belief that she can complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of itself," is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who takes the girl with her and justifies her exploitation with faith, is to give someone a chance that would otherwise not be educated and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret in Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent beatings. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Crimean in the household of the former military man TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira attacked MarÃ­n as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the Criadazgo's deep-rooted practice for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be indicative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo will come to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The life of a Crimean</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are exploited not only as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the farbik, where her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital of AsunciÃ³n in Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's house Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north east of Iraq, the animal rights campaigner Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see an Persian Leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video finds that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera trap Raza breaks out in sheer joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza pursues passionately a different side of her country, which is not only made up of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugat High School on Shizugelwa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugelwa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the North-East of Japan, documented the progress made in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "three-fold catastrophe" in March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was an important prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to escape because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture has not yet experienced a nuclear accident, alone for that reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing complex in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo paper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (which were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) were completed by December 2015.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima represents 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from house shelters (as for example, Kazetsu juutaku) are still trying to relocate to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36,000 people living in Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 are still living in shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of evacuees breathed in homes after the disaster were resettled to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, this figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo paper, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by the disaster have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident have severely affected the three prefectures of the agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agriculture in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima have been destroyed in the "nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has largely recovered, but Fukushima still lagged far behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo paper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuation. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feelings about the tsunami risk changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that it has not been done enough in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue marking the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung increasingly focused on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only witnessed the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants from Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuees in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old. they are well known for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be larger at first than the common ground.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, one often recognizes that one is more connected than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba included the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The national community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It's been two years since the activities were lame in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succumbing, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories which are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back into operation because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls perfectly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but bad harvests have already been no news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound has to remain, according to the 2016 published report "Agricultural perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Nutrition Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane plant Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closing of the factory, the word he repeats most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first shooting year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of official written documents which would differ only in terms of the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was overtaken and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the defunct factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane production still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed he dismantled one of his 31 work years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial zone of Cuba and the most important work counterparts was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the then president looked into the eyes of those present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the local community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane plant closed, or better said, when they began to remove it, they also stopped to aspire the road, this disadvantaged other farms as well.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without prospects, many young people left the region once again.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production serves not even for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene came back to factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this through Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop band The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop begins with the participation of young participants in discussions on topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska State University.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitaroquium First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section of road in Western Canada, where almost two dozen indigenous women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the teenagers don't always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmaoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a strophe in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the stanchion is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I still try to go on Earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that one day we will rise up</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go ahead with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator has appointed for.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("Plastic models of dishes") of every dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers view these plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Togu neighborhood of Kappabashi there are many small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend reverses them today in striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matomas the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic trays, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food adjustments is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part was also produced for the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone stands and mobile phone designers will allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or nitrous oxide is used, a popular opping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">There are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more whimsical plastic dishes you can watch under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and the killed regularly appear only in stats. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or on the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bone discovered in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico founded the digital project "Apring a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug trafficking"), which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between law enforcement and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico discusses the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only allows us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how Fear Changed Life" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret graves for his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "Priest:" "" "as every Sunday, we again prepare ourselves for the task that we have asked to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Apriting a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we don't have to show only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the governance." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter in what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass by newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to be Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified, that they were" "" "soaking" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to argue that they are spared by such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months extortion in the capital district: how a family with threats was plundered." in this she describes how armed criminals peaked monthly for month from their business until they destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes, the trauma is left, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Kids of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation Designed by Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, tortillas and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He talks about the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had gone by two years before, when he had just removed a few blocks from his home, saw the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was like:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizens council for public safety and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office counted 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 million per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprating a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant painstaking reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected for years and thereby devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths filled with potholes, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the ambulance fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball which enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby, full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses were scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture entitled" "" "This is Nigeria." "" "the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Multiple photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken on social media, blogs and other platforms several times and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses have reported drastically about atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained behind to count corpses," "" "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by satellite images the follow-up period could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the potential scale of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was taken as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments like this mistakenly counterfeit the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning strike, published by the United Nations describes those who could flee, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, which in 2012 falsely claimed that the President of Myanmars Thein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the picture from the DR Congo to depict this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence linked to the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life are both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are eighty people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and humiliates the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that stopping images from a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is concern that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers, and the ability to feel empathy (such as this study investigating how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss in the news media about violent representations, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used intentionally from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international it can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog named untranslatable (e. unenforceable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from all over the world, which are difficult or impossible to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these insurmountable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish Sobotesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But they all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online-list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's Taxes, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- worry about your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your recent years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik Speech spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish even more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why I'm telling this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are being waged and people are being enchanted by creating the "other" in public performance, was even scientist of Stanford about four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and unaware of the "other"; as my girlfriend and I imagine a new future in which we have no president who is bombarding chocolate cake, going far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now, in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of language of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been performing events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the feasibility of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that adopt diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While listening is often associated with understanding "these events" instead "listen to listening in order to appreciate, to make sense."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first introduce their history in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and representation make it possible for the audience to act accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konata also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the fables of the rabbit and the Baboon in Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers are hoping to extend it. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico demand re-setting of public debt from the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place at 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march started at the Mexican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was proclaimed by the French group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural audit of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the reindebtedness of the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a leadership committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed salary that operates in favour of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, was dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is available here, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military facility.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police" had taken Bassel on the basis of a "strictly secret" order of the Military Tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons who presided over the Assad administration on 12 November 2015 and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the leader of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototype was more prescient than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would do everything to embody this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggles the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is freely available.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover by Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora entitled "It Happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens every time you visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink into the world of your lovely eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace</seg>
<seg id="1231">That every one of the dangers does not matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crowding of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I'll go into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion with me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return quickly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of Bassel's arrest, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes by, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While at the same time</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bastille's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of protests in 2011 against the regime Bashar al-Assad, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 according to the International Human Rights Organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, Director of prison sentenced to provisional posts after prison</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for dispersal of 54 million people.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council was the member of the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately demanded his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the motion, there was no reason for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not called the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, CIP) condemned the company's decision to put the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and had no adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "adverse" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Unobtrusive!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil, says the director doesn't have any moral morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morals and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºt prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, who will not only remember the Mozambique as the first independent president, but also as sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic sayings.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral presentations was when he firmly affirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of all, also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or fissures.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network adopted their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook has censored the word "Kalar" or "al-to-the-point" (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciatory connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt about their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings which have the same alphabet sequence as' kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, a chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the phrase ku la -" "" "healing" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet thinks that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before delaying all posts that are suspected of being racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism won't understand what you are writing on Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words next to it.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who promote hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to print, post and share content for 24 hours because the mail "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his views on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intent to lessen racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word 'kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which did not contain hate speech but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads, "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and look at an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says," "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is intended to incite violence in the communes of Myanmar in particular, especially in the area of Rakhine where conflict between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to control the balancing hate speech on his Burmese sites.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code-concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who had already been married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media moves that endeavored to abolish children's marriage laws followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition aroused tensions in this uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Yet at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country senators gave a status update on Facebook that Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the Bill against Child Commons was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>

<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, advocate of the law, said that unless Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>

<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based on encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-savvy Internet users are used to using reverse tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third largest VPN prevalence), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform laid down all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is in spite of legal prohibition, however, irrevocable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the block of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on distributed and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when the respective country Wikipedia is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and employee of mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server will forward the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlender Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and well-balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just arrived at home when suddenly he called me (the manager of Chitwan Gaida). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was and I immediately began to gnash pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to attain worldwide recognition of Nepal's nature and wants to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood up to tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when the king of the boy suddenly appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at Bardia National Park footage of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photographed a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanova and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, it avoids women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should ignore the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was condemned by a pseudo-court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of not naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have much less assignment to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe, in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city's main topic.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to uncover practices such as children's marriage right up to the marriage of HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and heads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was of women who do not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not speaking aloud to the names of their husbands is a custom that they all uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her name, wanted to try out at home as it is.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everyone," "" "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a century-old tradition in which married women are never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only choked before her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that indicates the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnowledge run if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped doing so, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion with every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months, for the first time in their life they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to tell certain things, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Saleh Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morality linked to the saris and much more, Rohini adorned their own couple of critos (shirts) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done little steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then again stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear vermilion on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as violets for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice made by the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "news of those who experience it themselves," and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29 this year, the Hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The Beatles' visit in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the post-war Japanese culture.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here soon realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles first came to Japan in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," says Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today Beatles Day is a memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the familiar places related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">As you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (New York State Memorial)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">Pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today Beatles Day is a memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">It was exactly this year that the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fan base in the market, such as this Ramen Shop (Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "today and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya." ""</seg>
<seg id="1579">This is how the day is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1580">So, we hope you're there!</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and some of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a man of bald man could contain or bring gold, the police spokesman ZambÃ©zia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on men of bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are implicated in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrbala, Province of ZambÃ©zia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head would have power to generate wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably done recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after taking part in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a speaker that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to release views from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to permit him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summed up some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. Norway signed an agreement only in June to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed its hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as she announced in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions on Mr. Liu's wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad informed that the Americans" "" "would like him to have the possibility of treatment abroad, insofar as he can help him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy's invitation drew a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Prior to that, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported news agency Reuters that China had big concerns about whether the vortex of Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide Liu with adequate health care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's attorney told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release those impervious to the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In an explanation on 29 June, the Foreign Office of France called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually accept it.</seg>

<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of mainland matters in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to let itself be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08, who stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly as Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very postive: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries." in view of this, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, abandoning the distorted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He offered relevant questions in a rational manner with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requests Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">As Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said Singapore was more of a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneasy, even if we enjoy free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said to Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what awaits me - be I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that, right associates and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discusses the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam committed" "" "good faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">According to the journal Journey of a Decade on Bejahung, Singapore, Journey of a Decade was and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many Singapura...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country" "", "etc., but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook internally before anger when they are kept for Americans, but it doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians differ from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward, but the real problem is that "nice" doesn't have personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means unobtrusive and uninteresting and paying no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that is paroding the Junta, which in 2014 seized the power and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video still refers to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video about the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video loaded on Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, as it relates to the situation of the country under the rule of Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above illustrates the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosecute people who were accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand uses a strict malice against" "" "Lese Majeste" "" "(" "" "Majestic Violation" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup d'etat of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black vans before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band who imitated the Salut "The Tribute to Panem," which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"" "" "" "on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality." ""</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacles frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the names Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, tells Mrs RamÃ­rez, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have been sleeping outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, she buys medicines they cannot pay, she massages them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the circuit and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report to her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his office.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other people also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single teacher, offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to take.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travellers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she's browsing through her album with a lot of photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification to instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app informed the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages on digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit dissatisfaction and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China" based on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Mademos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (PIs) also published a Jingwang product description which shows that the software can uplift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the direction of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office upon operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an order to allow all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumqui's three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2057">I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he comes to me like that.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that glide away: "my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join those Tagedivines and protest in demonstrations that will soon come to an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have used it to not reply.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can no longer say exactly when insults and punches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with it, and you cannot hold back your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, so that they exchanged the pipe with a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest I asked myself if the investigator had worked as a waste collector sooner or if that was part of the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They intertwined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them changed, while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice too, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about LGBTQ + community rights, freedom of speech and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he snares to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as fellows (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questioned her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to Yemen in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not constrained by borders in his thinking, and he can feel his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion to the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a human," "" "while in water, NescafÃ© pours in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slugs speak of lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you take a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink water in the public during Ramadan, in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan canceled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Campaign - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinnai, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled" "" "just" "" "because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the band's engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free speech in the Arab world is a dangerous activism which asks the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an ever-clear crystallizing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib advanced traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'Ehrenmurders' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its peak in 2016, but even more difficult is Jordan's lack of institutional infrastructure to support women who have become victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 criminal offence law, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence must "indefinitely be imprisoned in prison" and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music is also very popular and is known not to shy away from issues that were considered taboo in his country for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot divorce his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I have been softened by politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" "" "Santorano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse repeatedly repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words, "get what one wants" - be it belief or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later note that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a modified version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuys, a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory thanks to his homophobic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuys, who was supposed to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the ashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service had arrested several former government officials and members of the Association of Teachers on the grounds that they had critically comments on comments in social media about the problems deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has fought Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's what Hdaib sees - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial ways of developing democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and, consequently, resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variant of Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many parts of Tohokus. another theory states that the strongholds, drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from western Japan marched to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region to push the emissism into their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to get some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literal).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed-cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">But for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and in addition a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">"" "Yattemare!" "" "# summer festival in the north of the country." ""</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outer appearances and body care were rarely as important as in this story, because they help keep the Peruvian youth out of the crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trade are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the fallen hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the skilled hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which takes place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other to show who can create the most eccentric look, as you can see in the following video (more videos about current contests can be found on the public Facebook profile of Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of youngsters have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love with the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Liebesbitions on guerilla fighters" "", "which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve released." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel excreted to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question did not leave the young Columbian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Carta por la ColliaciÃ³n campaign, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their share: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement of FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombiologists, however, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal refugee camps for many years have been subjected to a war rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into their lives as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred for guerrilla struggles, must now enter its ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians must unite and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla war, which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation began at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share with people this year to share his love with people who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizal, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything between them," said the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a co-worker of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in because next to him on the bed was an MGL shell, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To kick off, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up when there was war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC have explained the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State had spread to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can contribute to shaping society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">For example, Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cali, Archbishop of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after the disarmament there would be peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms, to rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who are defending life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>

<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you honour the family, you stain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything along and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in which the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it, but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having respect with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny and say that I didn't change my gender, that everything was bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, a car with darkened window panes and a plate with 95 seats stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you'd be safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it's the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had locked me in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That is what I mean, they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine told me that there were not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to the court of Kadyrov.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "When they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm just quoting someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports about it. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted us to" "" "civilised" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "" "" "the Ministry of Safety of the Sharia has never even curbed a hair." ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yeah.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who were laughing and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I returned home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreaps, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I cleared away places of escape.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">It is nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to show you foam in front of your mouth that there are no coils.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The stanchions have what the cabardins have, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet there is it - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about transitions in men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to feel ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on 27 August withdrew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, according to Ahrazi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video, split onto YouTube, held the moments after he lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ahrazi minority in August, and activists in the area warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights declared that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Tamim - have imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to pursue their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy acquired power and in 1925 much effort was undertaken to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi Arabs workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams to divert water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawtsmen rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis who seek a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahmed human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among the young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic patterns emerging in Ahraz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living out of their native country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi have to endure, human rights activists raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the site of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put forth well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we ought to be all feminist in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For instance, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to talk on skin color, on black Cis women, on black women in LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to sing" to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and home towns earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all the women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which relate to both the sex and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "journeymen complained in their speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized being in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and sex, as some of them will continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "Feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: claims (for example: Africa-Womanism: how we reconquer ourselves) says that we can defend ourselves in this way also spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists instantly call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, please let me know about the hypocrisy and contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can raise black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2468">This article will be published again within the scope of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa has travelled extensively over the past seven years - mostly with a surfboard or canoe - with a special concern from Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," relates Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the NGO "Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in one question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurturally. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin), who reports on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A Police Commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has gone by and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena on account of abuse, Ada BÃ¡ez did not profit anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make a refund at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to prosecution authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 Strikes and Statistics 2 Unvisible abuse and a legal system that is nothing submersible 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate conversion beatings and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudio, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 advertisements for domestic violence took place at District Attorney's Office. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do it, but after that she was still looking for it. this should be regrettable for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women have happened that are too subservient because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and related how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed the so long Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fÃ¼rst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-eWenders) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law stipulates that a perpetual criminal offence is to be declared and tougher as it is already the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the law was changed in a number of ways in order to also gain deputies for the law that feared that the road to decriminalize abortions, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punishable with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had foreseen that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence have to bear at the present time, if they just wanted to report ad and receive secure accommodation, would impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"" "" "" "there must be a change in mind so that violence is no longer seen as something normal." ""</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law in the Paraguayan Senate was passed. prior to that, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, a passage was canceled, which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Ottoman authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn for its coverage of corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, serving a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and brought to court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been in power since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had defeated his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he has held the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterised by the insistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, civil liberties, including freedom of the press, restricting and incarcerating human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically obstruct peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted, inter alia, for the disruption of public order, "abuse of the internet" and "undermining the prestige of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of 3,000 anomalies (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year ban on occupational disability was imposed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after being found guilty of the use of "an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a security deposit of $5000 was fixed (13,000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the verdict was announced.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the Central prison in Maskat. al-Haj remains in prison, where he served his one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to relinquish Azamn, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Romanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the minister presented himself once again against the decision of the Court of Appeal to allow the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing shutdown of Azamn and attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren't the only cases in which Oman has recently violated the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of print on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detention of journalist Al-Haj, the impression is that the authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR, calls on the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far-reaching effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDR).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic demonstrated the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently lies the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samb national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently working on a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipients instead of being a macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not good in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What barriers are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is in your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for specialized scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of living as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com's website, a magazine about solutions to environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding Salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the early 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only valid for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton always breeds Salad, but meanwhile he needs longer, since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a boulder in a river that I have to catch." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, nobody can breed a new type of salad, because all the features have already been patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement growing in the US and around the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red reddish lettuce of the variety Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source seed initiative (initiative for open source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called briefly Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue doing business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and not immediately sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffolding prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board Member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds therefore play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmer's rights, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," he says. "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is compromised, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, deals with genetic variation in carrots and their availability in her doctoral thesis. she found that about one third of all cartel features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be harnessed either at all.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates do not yet exist for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that large-scale plants such as wheat can be patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genetic banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property limits other breeders as" "" "patents and the protection of plant-varietate innovations support innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing the public with more material and expertise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops adapted to changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to be: "independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Altogether, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant traits: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are required mass herbicides, breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that operate in international markets, but are smaller than Monsanto) patents, most smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I work with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than a company that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected for 20 years from competition, which makes it very easy to do in my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed programme. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the centre is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that fulfill certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also helps them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agreements is working on an open-source licence, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi commitment cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable.</seg>
<seg id="2689">One explanation, however, is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's "Open Source" seed systems, states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems, which should be the official starting signal for the planned next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A consortium of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, published a report published by McKnight Foundation and others. it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed policies to ensure stable food supply.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon see it.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby.

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still ban content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANYI), which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world, and reports on them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains unleashed in spite of this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities which should actually defend the law, to pass on freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now. ANTOO confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockage and not to impart. we insist on further fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">HRI is the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-derived network of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation has fallen victim to the wave of web page blocking. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANDRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher, Ahmed Gamal Ziada, has no access to Egypt anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which also Ziadas's blog is given a home, is still available.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blockage and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blogging of blogs might not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They succeeded in conveying to me the feeling of a state of siege; An arrest, a attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web page I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles in order to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after locking him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous enter the road to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked off from 24 May to 6 August 133 webpages. this resulted in technical testing in the networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of providers, through the transfer of Internet censorship and private surfing possible, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the locking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will it next attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos pÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Newspapers in Brazil are reporting day after day with gloomy headlines in Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot at school," "" "Every other day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" Thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons, "" "" President Temer sends 8500 soldiers from the army, navy and air lake to Rio. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that happens by civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry out: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to retouch atrocities of the police, who only shoot and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is justifiable.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: Rio de Janeiro State is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro as" "" "the most violent place in Brazil" "" "is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date available data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders per federal state, Rio is on number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as CecÃ­lia pointed out, has been repeating the state security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police fund and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor municipalities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes the penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared up the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons attacked the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21, 2013, is particularly affected.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas have been besieged by rebels in controlled areas outside Damascus, which resulted in inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own fungus as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not among the traditional foods that are planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, who has been fighting for three years to post this project and express its relief that it is becoming more and more known. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of the cultivation of mushrooms, as Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of approximately 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortages, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began with the" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "" "before they checked their quality and, if they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger bath tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and around 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government to excel in solidarity with the victims last week for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded by fires.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal declared the paper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did nowhere: there are dozens of testimonies of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"" "in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened as in June, as the roads were closed very late." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the shape of the forest adopted by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open backdoor allowing everything to be built," JoÃ£o Sorval continues in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, spread to the fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when people sought information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it uses the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who persecuted the fires.</seg>

<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf returned to Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his small wage, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar which were heavier than himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharqi came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharqi homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high number of pregnancies, but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3000" "" "special recording centres" "". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum, which can withdraw after the registration of the asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who do not have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">That's how it came to Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible life-wille helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions very soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharqi made his entire savings to the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the companies in Afghanistan have arisen, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant orient experience, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail and aim back to the country he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk are opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "thus, they can sell their crop yields on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity remain.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharqi has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans along this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 on Twitter shared.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Netize Report is an international snapshot, showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the removal of a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been applied by sixty Members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another Member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal to introduce harder penalties for the insult of the president or a senior official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposal, however, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who captured Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the impeachment of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting for four years in prison for a court appointment with more than 700 participants who had been arrested by the same incident.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to May 20, because according to human rights groups, the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent load of among others weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza spoke to the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists arrested leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, expressly supported a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption charges official amnesty, provided they return all unlawful received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April sheds light on the presentation of the presidential plans to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the appointment of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Government Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "in the provisions, it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will mean the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizens "journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the provincial government as an "organizer of information distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law that provides the Russian government with a list of online services that make the "release of information." the law also allows the government to make obdurate services for the removal of content and to force it on request for the execution of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnovice Niki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blockage Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blockade Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia admins refused to clear two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications stated that the site was blocked because it became" "" "an information source cooperating with groups to foment a political diffrent campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website, including China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet Service Providers to monitor communication in real time and to install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunication companies and secret services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation is still ongoing until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
