that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones from Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA provided literally blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been investigating bre@@ aches and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , to den@@ ounce whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous that they reveal .
so when the government le@@ aked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they had for years indication that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
rather than to fail and bring tears to the statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , ordered his telephone calls secretly ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit meeting , and even travel information with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Anderson , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en as a source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower left to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they get in contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software , which has not yet existed since Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source distribution system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet presence known by us Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now evolving from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer secretly obtain information , and many of the information they would require would not be available from the start .
however , Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important for us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to put away mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers ,
or the next environ@@ ment@@ alist who warns against the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street In@@ sider , who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that wealthy and powerful &#93; have hidden enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we received from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad let@@ ter@@ box firms has tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agency writer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems crying tears away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we tackle this ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for major public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because up to now there were no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples showing connections to the USA .
in fact , some US states require less information to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has allowed che@@ aters to pick up especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked all of us that all except one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as single cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very sad as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite well that things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has gathered in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties submitted a draft bill in both chambers of parliament , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama @-@ Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency that now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a post@@ age sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to end up in the luggage compartment of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ?
a wild alien sleeps in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , scre@@ aming to@@ e tips to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
it was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear to turn into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell to the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
have we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ h@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
through the internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , one senses the things that one can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we entr@@ ust .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet approach of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only once , who actually has Al Gor@@ es &apos;s cell phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is can@@ did@@ st for the Office of the President ?
you can now return your cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he really can hold on very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed over their assessments before making them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are with respect to age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when adding a person &apos;s call -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation makes common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your home ! I &apos;ll be on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put off those prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need not previously covered .
for us , business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties and have devast@@ ated homes .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts already when I think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men have confidence in one another .
if trust works , wonders can arise .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know them properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay runs off .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are just what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing coinci@@ de with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now easy to name the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing won &apos;t do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , this is to be compared with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood in a pub that you &apos;ve never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing a common part ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun .
were now offered residents , students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were drawn out . in@@ ku@@ b@@ ator programs started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreign or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did it work ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it start@@ ling ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da hits me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or repres@@ sed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
people probably don &apos;t talk to their drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee owner -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a fitness @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but don &apos;t sing like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to suit me with a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I did not only accept the faith of my parents pas@@ sively .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately thought .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone tru@@ sts you , fully understands you , and yet loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the Egyptian American Dream .
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should I do such a thing ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern descent ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect .
the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember seeing myself -- as we drove quietly -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , who said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims and sm@@ elled and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have taken the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are harsh .
today , we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ .
thank you very much !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces available , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant regard for people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the terrorists to be the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or fallen away from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS gro@@ pes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
when Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to the world of creation by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you very much !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups maintain their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when one casts a glance at them , it does not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her anger , she was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m was restoring the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight of how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy each day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study shows that when investig@@ ators submit messages that were neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood for Muslims is up@@ stairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when assign@@ ing collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was talented in the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was st@@ un@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such an accomplished young man become from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove quietly , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment , I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had cour@@ a@@ geous and con@@ dol@@ ent pan@@ ics and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say you &apos;re going to hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble think factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study conducted by Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so in no way I am an exception .
when humans seem like an exception usually , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers is close to becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
before air pack@@ et delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting to each other , flying units gain high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ yourself structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other Star@@ r@@ hi@@ fters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most starter motors it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what location the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically saf@@ est remote @-@ powered aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is simple mechanical , there is a lot of things happening inside the inner work@@ ings so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail star@@ ters . to bring it to flight , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of getting it right when everyone is watching me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in car@@ el@@ essness , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is simply symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller dies off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half in@@ capable .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine out there on Broadway wants to be a flying lamp shade .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , the reward lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , clever creatures allowed them to form them in so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed around each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for a short moment they sh@@ one more brigh@@ tly than all stars together in all the gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy , however , did not put them in the form of light --
we finally talk of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us sort the events in time .
1.3 billion years ago a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the Earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise approximately through colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gravit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run in order to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detector commissioning , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes prevailed throughout the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
in essence , they were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves made of black holes and their signals from observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . but what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gravit@@ ation is a twi@@ sting in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and moved into the other .
lec@@ turers in courses to the theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and du@@ ped when the waves are hit . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic essay on gravit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building these detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott like to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to make the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I &apos;m talking about Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision between two black holes , what my colleague Scott looks for quite a while .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular easy : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , one hears the same p@@ ant@@ y with an additional tone change . that &apos;s what sounds like : Yi@@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , embos@@ sed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I will never forget , Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear , realize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with a 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves an entirely new way of exploring the universe as never before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or basic -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through as these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own night @-@ light .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in All things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first attempt which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and comp@@ asses of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , put me in uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of eliminated my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life fundamentally to an unexpected . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treasures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on , I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or wherever I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very anxi@@ ous .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , bring you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in a grand style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programmes , 70 hours TV , three programmes that simultaneously are in production : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing it ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say it to you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I do not just walk around the computer and start imag@@ ining , and it is true when I say : I understand that it is not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I go deeper into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas .
as if we had a high sound , running a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and sensible . and the best part is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever on it .
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong@@ ly , that &apos;s what it does .
but hum@@ ming -- when I started to work and work and build , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sums are more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
hum@@ ming is music . hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t asp@@ ire differently than according to size .
the feeling of not being able to do anything other than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ ma .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called Gen@@ ie .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country that I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this sum . I love the h@@ um .
I need the h@@ um . I &apos;m the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum@@ ming ?
and then the sums stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ driven , burned out .
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when hum@@ ming stopped .
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz won &apos;t come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same ti@@ lit@@ an work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , no deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz was I .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fa@@ des away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l out , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you do , you love what you do , being a teacher , being a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you a hum@@ ming , when you know the bu@@ zz , when you know the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way to the outside , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things to be aware of :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anybody any more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and smo@@ kes my sums , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically out of the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country that I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is lost , or whatever the girl let go in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost enters .
and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz coming back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stick to the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the titan@@ ic um , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe my brain with the aid of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sums are not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on the love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream coming from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do so as a rule , so that as a work@@ ah@@ olic I can free myself from any guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to listen to the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not the way I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person works better than to be home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
we drove around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst the bubbles .
I feel mainly rigid , absent and confused .
I always travel to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe fulfilled me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and if my teen @-@ daughter speaks to me for a whole 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more it does not need .
everyone can spend 15 minutes a day , even at a bad day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are getting ready for bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I reti@@ re and I will be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
15 minutes a day , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is now my hum@@ ming .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the tot@@ ality of labour is part of me , but only a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s snow@@ ing to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan playing a trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country that I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ asses , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right tot@@ um : the hum@@ ming of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , descri@@ p@@ tive , bare and new feeling of life lies in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;m thinking about life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons are very frustr@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
they have probably heard of one of the most well @-@ known , &quot; Tiefen@@ hir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ it@@ ates an electrode deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that cran@@ ial @-@ brain trauma will s@@ well the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this you sometimes have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
allowing cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to succeed .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they par@@ ted slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they stem from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François was doing .
and then mark them in color to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ imported them to the receiving place of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we reim@@ plant@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ plant@@ anti@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
you had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor motor range in the motor cor@@ tex .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , as is the case with the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ plant@@ anci@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after the reim@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms in order to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years will it take for someone to come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that it is necessary to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changing circumstances .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , succ@@ umb to an error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies will be bri@@ ghter , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused means of cash , which is too sc@@ ary to invest where it would be productive and generate income , with which one could bear the debt burden and also produce all the things that mankind desper@@ ately needs , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth produced , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , etc .
3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sound like a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars hitting the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate stock markets and raise real estate prices .
debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , fears the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
invol@@ un@@ tary the circumstances causing the body to kill it .
this is my coat with capitalism --
his exceedingly wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean in democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many of them --
women , foreigners , and naturally slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive aspect of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same wei@@ ghting in questions of the sovereign issue .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long !
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burned out .
but today liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers .
the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies today , since the time when this separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually under@@ mining politics and making them escape .
wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not in a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my coat with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals they feed on , so that they star@@ ve at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the ine@@ quality is rising , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest in the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring politics and economy together again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; retains control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go out very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste becomes more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts deeper , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we need to re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical conqu@@ ests that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it take , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in the near future .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one place to another , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction is made between those who belong , but who do not work therein , and employees who work where the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- let us call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and each government is paying the amount corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that it was not the technical means at that time .
today , we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which they prefer privileged persons , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , globally Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how important is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BA : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the area of economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in a sense , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now pre@@ fers to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to our self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line through the euro@@ zone proc@@ eeded , and continues to be progres@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have still chosen the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BA : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister or minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring down our government because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were going on through the euro zone .
they did not want to admit that for the last 5 years they had a disa@@ strous programme in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika &apos;s credi@@ tors imposed upon us this policy conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ ges will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BG : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard the most before , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy has met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior consultant at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an icon @-@ hair@@ style and refers to Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows will receive this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after you have watched a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average paci@@ fication , the average television - the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free .
and when Amazon comes out for nothing , does one intervene , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
you collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon is supposed to make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give to the shows their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , what producers , what actors ?
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that this should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we can use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail in the US and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis , they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- by analy@@ zing Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , it was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life - at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics - an area where some very clever people use in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy .
or the development of a drug . over the years , I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly need two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its components , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put together parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all those parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first as they competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to ste@@ er our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . you just have to shake the ball in order to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right here at that moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will fight it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , when you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis , to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and take risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
