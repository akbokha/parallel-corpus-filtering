<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that NSA illegally listened to phones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA provided literally blueprints to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been investigating breaches and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, to denounce whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous that they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government leaked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had for years indication that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and bring tears to the statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, ordered his telephone calls secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit meeting, and even travel information with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Anderson, a CIA whistleblower and Risen as a source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower left to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they get in contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which has not yet existed since Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source distribution system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet presence known by us Aaron Swartz, and is now evolving from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer secretly obtain information, and many of the information they would require would not be available from the start.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important for us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to put away misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmentalist who warns against the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street Insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that wealthy and powerful] have hidden enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we received from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad letterbox firms has tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency writer or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying tears away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for major public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because up to now there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples showing connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some US states require less information to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to pick up especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked all of us that all except one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very sad as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite well that things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties submitted a draft bill in both chambers of parliament, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama-Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency that now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made a postage sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while paying the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to end up in the luggage compartment of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed, screaming toe tips to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">When I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear to turn into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell to the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Have we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blehczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, one senses the things that one can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we entrust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who actually has Al Gores's cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidst for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements that all say: "he really can hold on very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "" "" "because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively." ""</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed over their assessments before making them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are with respect to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when adding a person's call -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation makes common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- -- the request is not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "great works of art in your home! I'll be on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put off those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need not previously covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties and have devastated homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts already when I think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wonders can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know them properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay runs off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are just what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing coincide with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now easy to name the" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing won't do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, this is to be compared with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood in a pub that you've never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents, students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were drawn out. inkubator programs started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreign or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it startling,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda hits me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or repressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">People probably don't talk to their drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee owner -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A fitness-fitness-fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But don't sing like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to suit me with a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only accept the faith of my parents passively.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately thought.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone trusts you, fully understands you, and yet loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I got married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had a child later, after my marriage, and basically lived the Egyptian American Dream.</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked up on the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical error?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "..." Middle Eastern descent... "..." Jihad... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember seeing myself -- as we drove quietly -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, who said," "" "Be alert," "" "Be careful," "" "Stay in well lit areas," "" "Don't be sampled." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings came:" "" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims and smelled and smashed.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have taken the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are harsh.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole, and a benign tumor can only be observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US's body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic champions.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces available, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant regard for people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing that causes the terrorists to be the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or fallen away from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS gropes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to the world of creation by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups maintain their ideology on their" "" "Holy Book." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">But when one casts a glance at them, it does not exaggerate what they read in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her anger, she was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam was restoring the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight of how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy each day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when investigators submit messages that were negatively reported about Muslims, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood for Muslims is upstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective debt, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented in the Faculty of Medicine, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did such an accomplished young man become from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we drove quietly, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled out my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courageous and condolent panics and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say you're going to hold a TEDTalk, a thinker with a draught, working in a noble think factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as ordinary as allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest study conducted by Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So in no way I am an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When humans seem like an exception usually, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters is close to becoming a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower from 1500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting to each other, flying units gain high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-yourself structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrhifters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starter motors it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what location the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically safest remote-powered aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and lateral rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is simple mechanical, there is a lot of things happening inside the inner workings so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail starters. to bring it to flight, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of getting it right when everyone is watching me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in carelessness, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is simply symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller dies off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half incapable.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine out there on Broadway wants to be a flying lamp shade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us, the reward lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, clever creatures allowed them to form them in so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago two black holes circled around each other in a very far distant galaxy, so they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For a short moment they shone more brightly than all stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy, however, did not put them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally talk of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us sort the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago a multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which arise approximately through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser Interferometer gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run in order to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector commissioning, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes prevailed throughout the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves made of black holes and their signals from observatories like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravitation is a twisting in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and moved into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers in courses to the theory of relativity often perform a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and duped when the waves are hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic essay on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building these detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott like to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to make the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now I'm talking about Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision between two black holes, what my colleague Scott looks for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same panty with an additional tone change. that's what sounds like: Yiwu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, embossed in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, which at least I will never forget, Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] Somebody who knows what to hear, realize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with a 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves an entirely new way of exploring the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or basic -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own night-light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in All things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things in the first attempt which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and compasses of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, put me in uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life fundamentally to an unexpected. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "treasures" "" "for inexplicable reasons," ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "little, I need milk for my beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on, I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or wherever I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very anxious.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, bring you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programmes, 70 hours TV, three programmes that simultaneously are in production: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you are a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I do not just walk around the computer and start imagining, and it is true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go deeper into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if we had a high sound, running a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and sensible. and the best part is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrongly, that's what it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But humming -- when I started to work and work and build, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">Humming is music. humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't aspire differently than according to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to do anything other than striving for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes the more work there is, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country that I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the hum. I'm the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this summing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, overdriven, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Look, I want to go to Shonda land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz won't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same tilitan work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, no delegating, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fades away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Heul out, stupid author-titanium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do, you do, you do, you love what you do, being a teacher, being a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you a humming, when you know the buzz, when you know the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way to the outside, late, and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anybody any more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and smokes my sums, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically out of the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country that I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is lost, or whatever the girl let go in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost enters.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stick to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no mystery. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the buzzing, the titanic um, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe my brain with the aid of broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream coming from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True humming ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do so as a rule, so that as a workaholic I can free myself from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to listen to the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not the way I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person works better than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We drove around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst the bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly rigid, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always travel to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe fulfilled me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you'll keep me naive for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And if my teen-daughter speaks to me for a whole 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more it does not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes a day, even at a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are getting ready for bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I retire and I will be victorious. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a day, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my humming.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The totality of labour is part of me, but only a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons are very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have probably heard of one of the most well-known, "Tiefenhirnstimulation." in doing so, one imitates an electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that cranial-brain trauma will swell the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove some swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Allowing cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They parted slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They stem from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François was doing.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-imported them to the receiving place of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplantate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimplantate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplantantiated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor motor range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, as is the case with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplantanciated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the reimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms in order to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years will it take for someone to come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that it is necessary to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchanging circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, succumb to an error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies will be brighter, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused means of cash, which is too scary to invest where it would be productive and generate income, with which one could bear the debt burden and also produce all the things that mankind desperately needs, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth produced, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, etc.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 trillion US dollars sound like a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars hitting the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, fears the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntary the circumstances causing the body to kill it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my coat with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean in democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, Athenian democracy closed too many of them --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and naturally slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive aspect of the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same weighting in questions of the sovereign issue.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long!</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">But today liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e., the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies today, since the time when this separation of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle between the two took place by gradually undermining politics and making them escape.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my coat with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably decimated the animals they feed on, so that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has so far cannibalised politics itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devaluated, the inequality is rising, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too frightened to invest in the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we need to bring politics and economy together again, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go out very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste becomes more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to reorganize the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical conquests that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," in which machines serve human beings and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it take, how could it look like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one place to another, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction is made between those who belong, but who do not work therein, and employees who work where the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- let us call it "the Cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and each government is paying the amount corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have it, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which they prefer privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage bin of history, and keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How important is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as a "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BA: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's point of view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the area of economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I may say this provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now prefers to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>

<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have still chosen the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BA: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring down our government because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were going on through the euro zone.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard the most before, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy has met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior consultant at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slender, has an icon-hairstyle and refers to Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows will receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after you have watched a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average pacification, the average television - the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon comes out for nothing, does one intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skips or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon is supposed to make a sitcom over four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give to the shows their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, what producers, what actors?</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time where we can use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the US and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis, they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- by analyzing Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, it was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data stream into decisions of life - at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics - an area where some very clever people use inconceivably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly need two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem in its components, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put together parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all those parts back together and make a show like "House of Cards" did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first as they competing for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "that's what the data says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to steer our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it's also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. you just have to shake the ball in order to get an answer." "" "most likely," "" "right here at that moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, when you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis, to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
