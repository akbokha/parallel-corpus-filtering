Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former cause of peasants .
Munich &apos;s oldest official card promotes exciting stories by day .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , which had to be exciting , because the car @-@ navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ ale of Bavaria within the state government , are anything but up to date - but very insi@@ ghtful .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one does not recognize as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called original papers were incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities .
according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying management , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon sought an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally stri@@ pped off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Mess@@ aging Management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the document sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like any other , found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison between earlier / today is most impressive , for example , the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was commissioned 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as Munich &apos;s city district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : zo@@ oming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ ries from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ me@@ val &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small par@@ c@@ els do not occupy more farmers there today , but gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the document , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Lü@@ nen &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based circle @-@ ray @-@ asylum was founded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the Au@@ er Venti@@ late &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was head of the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the ranking of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the staff to employ violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Director of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients , there was first room , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular power station in Haar in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ anism are now meeting in the area of the former prison .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
to the west lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings dating back to the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn family route takes place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizens &apos; rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Promotion of Col@@ ors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ian to take special care while traveling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to prosec@@ ute discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities that dispro@@ portion@@ ate minorities , prompted the group to publish the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited preced@@ ents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ ander died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during his trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office indicating that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are employed 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and cow@@ or@@ kers about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring money or make their relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I hate crime report program , which classi@@ fy the state in terms of the number of such violations in the country &apos;s 16th rank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued a travel warning for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration laws that will obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people on account of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial guidance following the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
soft @-@ fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on the spot .
at the rectangular court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ bach CD@@ U subur@@ ban met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , fed 40 dairy cows and as many young and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him an alternative marketing path@@ way for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the soft @-@ fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep areas .
the green area provides a lot of work and much needs to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental business and used this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he did not carry out a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the soft @-@ fence project and is glad about the leader support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be dra@@ gged out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of support
a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half has been promoted over leader , a quarter bearing the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regional Development Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state funding of soft f@@ ences .
the aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor system marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the prot@@ rac@@ ted area must not be hau@@ led ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened with re@@ for@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s soft @-@ down project 2018 .
the area of disclosure is 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing holy anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the suggestions of the president to dras@@ tically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not accept the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ ow@@ owners and liberty @-@ hed@@ geho@@ gs had ly@@ n@@ ched him if he had done it .
but he attacked its meaning , and in particular the meaning attributed to it as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base has been added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to later added , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the beg@@ ging words of Lazarus , the only ones in whom a state not only invites the old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the mis@@ erable waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical portra@@ yal .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives to bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not meant to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh stum@@ bled upon something .
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not to ligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship grid will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain from the team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her talk was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in its fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British team .
Schot@@ t@@ lands hitherto best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will participate at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season , which included victory with the British team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champion@@ ships , being the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; extremely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als will be involved .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team .
it shows just how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from the domestic politics to his political principles .
he shr@@ inks at criticism , for sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ch@@ ased him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said a lot of people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type such as Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very a@@ dep@@ t to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ generate his hair @-@ free head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of gro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ s @-@ filled people who wave the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ profits .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appeals to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary range of the news show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s associates described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook Er@@ a makes it easy to note a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical clo@@ ths or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County changed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter p@@ ens hit his lead .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his position , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project Online Pap@@ ers .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for comfort in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year passed the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he was laying down this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion on home .

&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) will be present in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are due to passive smoking a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Doctor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections turn out to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are somewhat half@@ way in time , &quot; said the manager of the agriturismo Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts against red lights and shut @-@ off gates is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting .
but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai province in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the char@@ med tu@@ ber is taken with eager , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mud water from nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a room @-@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which was stir@@ red up for independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island .
the journey involves a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the town with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs that were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst childhood mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port valued at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources valued at estimated USD 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in one officer .
pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Committee .
last year , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Continu@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of 2016 , which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensified as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim econom@@ ists come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have started selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous who moved to work in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the vern@@ ac@@ ular and j@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ k@@ ovo in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ the@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened kids told them that they should turn their lights on .
one of the soldiers had offen@@ ded their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ a Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried out cerem@@ onial arch@@ ways and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle constantly and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ ua Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; they say in an official document of TI@@ ME that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and challenged the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers just wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because it was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings occurred only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ the@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said he establishes a extra@@ judicial mechanism to lay down historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wi@@ ran@@ to made a withdrawal when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , which the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; claiming more than 1,000 victims of death in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the dead bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited village people prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s reloc@@ ation office .
the police said the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , like the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police bri@@ g@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ pu@@ dent for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ el , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many of them joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , in recent years thousands of people have been arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily det@@ ained , under the pre@@ text of &quot; security of national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the hub of Nab@@ ire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs available in the region tend to be the better educated and well @-@ aff@@ ed migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to keep their own company competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
beyond that , restrictions of media coverage remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , even though they gave them the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black@@ list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six p@@ acific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Y@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him . &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the session , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua would say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ k@@ ovo is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting , &quot; said Go@@ bai , the Chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that Jok@@ the@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ k@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims had a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not forget the perpet@@ rators of their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered brain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire recording the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise building in just two years , which one sadly calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the shou@@ ting of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who named George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4 : 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage came from the cl@@ adding , the outer casing for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) will be pleased with his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play Davis Cup single was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single .
these often very long , but also very much cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will continue to work on improving the applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal was already made to bring the finale to a neutral place .
new from 2018 are comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right next year in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the demands made in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to do less official media meetings before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey conducted by air passengers showed that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously forbidden objects passed by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they inad@@ vert@@ ently bore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had bel@@ ated that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers failed to ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent reported to have know@@ ingly worn items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it inter@@ viewed travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally got s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that people who most likely wear s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were the ones who most frequently fly .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA might look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k willingly ad@@ mits to the enormous number of reservations for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has under@@ min@@ ed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the increasingly trium@@ ph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more titan@@ ic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k first reveals a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has frequently promoted more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose ex@@ tradition has just begun .
Mus@@ k now cle@@ ars : 6@@ 3.000 re@@ orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that only non @-@ binding reservations are available .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations occurred , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 , all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , one million .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , we expect to expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , unprecedented production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the delay of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions smo@@ g causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of governmental environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint which had been raised against his prior spot in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a term that expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to blocking or del@@ aying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to adhere to dead@@ lines for implementation and then have been waiting to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EP@@ O more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take time seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the O@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not set to vote in the Senate .
the New York General Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had accused the EPA this week , said the group intends to uph@@ old the legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said .
in this case New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone is produced when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year may contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ it &apos;s surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , a ser@@ en@@ ade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Wir@@ el@@ buch . count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the nearby parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ gt@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , in addition to the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as described from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the community settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps of the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age came from the early medieval church right .
a bishop who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this Church of its own .
as a result , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the Bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two were dis@@ member@@ ed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded in 16@@ 92 for the first time , but was later to be released during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church @-@ mill and used it as fire@@ wood .
ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years of the history of the church .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius system as successor of Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn .
as promot@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen invite to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local ruler , Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
at the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk outside the cemetery takes place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers are setting out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
association wants to have permission from wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at that time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days before - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve of it because of a mol@@ ded fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of scheduled legal requirements , the authorised permit is still un@@ lawful and therefore to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the relevant letters have been made in the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; declared a spokes@@ man .
the circle takes it as an occasion to test the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not wish to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim Solo@@ ist . &quot;
the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , is planning the construction of four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
already last year , the company in which the town Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has concluded lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares large grounds .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - equivalent to approximately one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re is planning to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : Mr@@ s dies in terrible accident

city and dealer plan &quot; Heimat @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ Week@@ end
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract residents to the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city provides apart from the usual grocery store .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action aims not only on residents of the city and the surrounding area .
in preparation , there are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend , says Christian König .
the Municip@@ ality and the Trade Union cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; for the well @-@ being , including selling Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals had lost the city center when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to help li@@ ven up the city center - to the land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ cast@@ ed , had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen informed us that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ shopping &quot; day , Germany &apos;s third &quot; Heimat @-@ shopping &quot; day , will take part in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time .
next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

Tr@@ ump sat under pressure on the payment of the boundary wall after the en@@ forced tran@@ scripts of telephone call Mexico
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump invited Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president insul@@ ted him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and disclosed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US would be &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ines as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in the Mon@@ ro@@ e countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors , the in@@ mates flo@@ cked in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man broke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them met real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens rights activists have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old For@@ mer Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man for Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights activists .
for him , post @-@ creation serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual remembrance of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician puts a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 Mon@@ ro@@ e men and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the suspect has been on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the ly@@ n@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black color ten@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , settled in a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
bro@@ o@@ ks said that rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore wasn &apos;t from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they came from the jail and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , eliminated evidence and has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tu@@ cked up the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her depic@@ tion is vivid , gri@@ pping and is based on a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom would like to believe that he does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t connect with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - entered a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ ong@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to go back to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the sister scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene once again begins .
this time , when An@@ cona says the N word , he says sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman dressed in mour@@ ning stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays ch@@ ur@@ ning pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks out at every second word .
about a hundred y@@ ards behind it a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gy &apos;s oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the grave of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a young boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw hu@@ gs Mar@@ ong@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ sow embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience gets together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the night@@ fall with a black couple they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which left the performance behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks sits at his table , eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colourful , fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a foam block with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ine &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked , in which the Rhine @-@ mon@@ gers pose as rock @-@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which is drawn by its &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren just like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .

later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
stor@@ my celebrations are Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly and decisi@@ vely bend their hands on the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat in casual casual clothing .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
in 2013 , when he had to leave a bell concert for himself , five years later , there were great jubil@@ ations in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were sub@@ merged .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of their views .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max capacity works as a volunteer
they are working at several places in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide range that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I did a high school gradu@@ ation .
and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off .
I realized that it &apos;s wrong for me and I want to do something different , work with people .
and then I asked what you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , you can see how it is locally , at the focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you are doing your FS@@ J .
it can be done from old people to youth work - in all facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me it was just the right thing that provoked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
unlike in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , it &apos;s not about calculating st@@ atics .
you always have other people &apos;s heads , each with a different story behind them .
whether a refugee asks if a youth who has been taken out of the family - you must always deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and divi@@ des the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British training group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will disman@@ tle more than 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job cuts , which CEO John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and at the start of 2019 , will be added to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
at a third cost @-@ cutting programme , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed on suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , decl@@ aring a NATO statement .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first six months of 2017 there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack , since the US @-@ led troops displaced the Tali@@ ban in 2001 .
the violence asser@@ ts the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering raising the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policy and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Decision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Rule after K@@ ills
the US environmental protection authority has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states compl@@ ained about the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ determin@@ ations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it shows the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the EPA &apos;s intention to assess the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed law@@ suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental claims imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump should boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have provoked the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the plot is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take place until the area belonging to the church has so far been owned , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the Administration and the Maj@@ ority of the Municipal Council pres@@ ume that such a common area is not a meeting place for the inhabitants of the un@@ equ@@ itable dwelling , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current household is determined by funding opportunities already last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent , would be eligible for the establishment of a common room .
the resolution proposed in order to signal the investor that in this respect it is not necessary to throw sticks between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding buildings - as well as the pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks this addition .
if it helps : he passes the board unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela responded to the many of his own buildings , with whom you can &apos;t go so well , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a communal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter@@ value , which can be seen in doubt in doubt , is the counter @-@ address .
three pro@@ pon@@ ents will be found in the State &apos;s request to impose the proposed resolution accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case with two opposing voices in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we put the decision in such a way , we make a huge step towards closing a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision by car : cyclists are thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling by 12.@@ 20 clock with his bike on the bike path of Schwar@@ zer Weg , coming from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder ro@@ de into the street , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the opposite traffic .
he colli@@ ded with a car who contributed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown on the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital by means of a ret@@ ou@@ ch car .
FC Bayern Munich has to disp@@ ense with the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season with staff worries .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the staff of the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six review games , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team responsible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know we &apos;re not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin from star to star hike
in the resin , the nation @-@ wide first &quot; star path &quot; is to be built .
the association is planning the observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the information needs of many har@@ p@@ visitors , but it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question comes from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be completed by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ path Ticket will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , even though it was far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been running the highest observ@@ atory Northern Germany in the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the University of Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet route since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the planet @-@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exact 75 @-@ meter @-@ distant sun measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the stal@@ k with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ alist Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions world champion , Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas commented that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight divi@@ ders &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes need this battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ on@@ enko must compete with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their Light@@ weight title battle in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , expressing himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave a generous compli@@ ment to Gar@@ cia and said that he thought the three @-@ battle champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to co @-@ play . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after punc@@ ture punc@@ ture
in an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the connection point .
the car hur@@ led right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then rested on the roof in the green strip .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; supply chain works better &quot;
according to the 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the defense formation in Au@@ e points brings points .
with the first match of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , wouldn &apos;t the two opponents have been against Brun@@ swi@@ ck at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to pay better attention in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s defense player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free fall , the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better prepared according to the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I do not yet know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm spark@@ le , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the 3 @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not afford so many f@@ laws under construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , also Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will surely be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; I only judge the start into the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely due to an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el und Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favorite in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una interior defender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland come from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is absolutely positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2 . Bundes@@ li@@ ga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s executive coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so spark@@ le doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ holder review contest published
recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new way to medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Auth@@ orities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
up to now , migration insurance has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases &quot; suggest@@ ing that the person under investigation is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , during X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of biological maturity of humans to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of ass@@ essing a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Construction and Transport at the District President of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at the same time on all three need for refur@@ bish@@ ment between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and light is sure that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come to the years .
in order to guarantee stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ structured .
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach river .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
on Wednesday morning the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach took a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the northern side .
this is an edge fixing that is also used as an operating path .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian path is to run .
the special thing about it is that it deals with finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a particular sense of finger @-@ sharpen@@ ing .
this is because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the works .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the con@@ vo@@ y in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is frozen by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the costs for the three bridge installations amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the District Day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on that day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ stein Stad@@ thalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud campaign &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and deputy chairman of the Federal Republic of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on @-@ site at the beginning of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colourful &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; planned on the well site , but now takes place on the parking lot below the ring - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; it &apos;s great how many people came together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; original German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes told by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to do such an event and received the bid .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n first , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : around 20 o &apos;clock a band provides entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to keep their speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but up to now the police had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move away - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
you can listen to the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; hits a classic German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov is solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trump@@ eter of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free playing combine to form an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; .
the probably best @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the Twi@@ light colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette act@@ ress insur@@ es against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with anyone whom I have given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten said she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed du@@ alism .
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them she suffered from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but during the school @-@ time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public does not like to explain her love life : &quot; people expect you to express yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal store from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party which would rather hin@@ der us than to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be incorporated into the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the ban@@ ishment of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been caught out of gold and silver med@@ als at competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e Repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation recognized for itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ deplo@@ y Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture given by the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
soldiers crashed in Mali
during a funeral service in the north h@@ ess@@ ischen F@@ ritz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security provisions .
the Minister of Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the still un@@ solved issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two ann@@ ot@@ ated pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen died on Wednesday a week in Mali &apos;s west Africa .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
then the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Federal Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
ro@@ ses settled down , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence by the De@@ an described the coming soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steep@@ ed in &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann developed the flight operation of the helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger @-@ pilots of his regi@@ ment .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn down the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
no doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen not pointed out that the application is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are being buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , and she said it further in his message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also laid down the title &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the spokes@@ woman of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympathy of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was vac@@ ant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the call to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP of the possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
this spoke out on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
earlier , the unexpected withdrawal of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in the State Parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former member of the Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to include it .
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Land@@ tag of Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected regular on January 14 next year .
stum@@ ers said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the parliament &apos;s parliament draws the trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be verified legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; stum@@ ers called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but somewhat curious &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself pointed out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens urged the back@@ sliding MPs to return their country mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that they will return their Land@@ tag mandate , which they have received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the President of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret El@@ ke T@@ ill &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the light of the fact that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of Lower Saxony &apos;s MPs El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re@@ election the Land@@ tag .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her pen@@ ultimate vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests in the welfare of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty game of intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of distor@@ ting the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was at that time in front of the SPD the strongest force , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves against gre@@ ed , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Herr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to check carefully the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , a health threat is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ ten@@ er is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since we become acquainted with Germany &apos;s sad@@ ness .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade also has to ensure that the products sold are able to transport and are safe to health .
if the residual oil content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the farms are not to blame .
are manufacturers and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , production plants do not make any immediate blame .
rather , due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies , they have to reck@@ on with economic damages .
as always there are too little controllers in the seri@@ ousness of the event .
is it missing only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive back@@ war@@ dness ?
it was just the official controls that uncovered the process .
but the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ utor in the cases where off@@ ences can be found is of decisive importance .
I have already made a number of times clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to exclusively get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pan@@ try means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ xed il in the attitude of food@@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are quickly and comprehen@@ sively elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of football will affect N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed spending of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization controlling the European game has the power to forbi@@ d teams from access to the prestigious champi@@ ons League tournament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to show that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona has paid $ 2@@ 22 million ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to extract Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar is signing and bringing him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , in the face of the financing of the team by the rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate income sources , which allow them to reach the break @-@ even point in their business related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who in their quest for success had taken enormous debts , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentr@@ ating on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
during the current FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , its UEF@@ A successor , A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ sl@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red from excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for billing according to the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the selling prices for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by businesses connected with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship exceeds the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not count it as legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship value was set up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments made by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup will be held and such a maneu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regulatory authorities is easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer , announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a bene@@ fici@@ ary for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G .
ar@@ senal manager Ar@@ sene Kies@@ inger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier
over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y made Board Cho@@ col@@ ate for Swiss Life .
now the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
around 17 million small red @-@ white wrapped top @-@ up panels of 14 grams each year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss authorities did not want to disclose information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in line with &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a sho@@ oter manufacturer it is a prestigious job .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are involved in the new ten@@ dering process .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract for spring 2018 .
for the s@@ there , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board its flights since 2006 .
before joining a contract with Mig@@ ros , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo at the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y two and a half years ago .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights the customers of First Class are spo@@ ilt by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , Business Class wal@@ lowing passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is also spread on the short circuit by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ th years , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge period ( as the Vor@@ ds@@ men David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the sket@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd lob@@ ster ( it contained original history for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) .
as they stiff@@ ened at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny kids that grow up - nevertheless they managed to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the watering can principle , including a riff to the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; Die hand that cri@@ es the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character can rum@@ mage through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now nov@@ aut@@ or , still hasn &apos;t forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot involved in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s great fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s mou@@ sta@@ che of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
these are the moments of random del@@ u@@ sions that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; which will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon meanwhile rec@@ alls another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his east @-@ west @-@ west rally @-@ icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy , created by Brian Gat@@ eb@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , gives a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lica whose di@@ alo@@ gues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , how Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides for a decent play &apos; Fin@@ ding the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an M@@ ask is involved - that it often plays as a single .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited down to a lower length , could better deliver Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re because Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef continued to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do anything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was informed on Friday .
15 complain@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 years and 77 , and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the function@@ aries secured larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime of drugs , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
that is why the Grand deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four cler@@ ks from Palermo .
in particular , Italian nation@@ als with a close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia went into the spotlight of the investigations .
also a incident on 27th May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise compl@@ ains of large gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Federal Government Commissioner , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the immigration centre register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned manner in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
because the data wasn &apos;t sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who are no longer alive , or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , which would not have to leave at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false analo@@ gies led to a distorted debate on how to deal with an exit fee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states , therefore , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it says that BA@@ MF is introducing such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible , according to the newspaper , pointing to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU State is responsible for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatened because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system , un@@ lawful admission conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ ri@@ chen@@ bach provided blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
first of all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the congregation &apos;s meeting , the congregation acknowled@@ ges multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are laid out for it and we respect the don@@ ors who make their blood available to foreigners , yet to do so un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the group leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the change to the theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer were counted among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave out ten times each 500 milli@@ litres of their juice .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to disclose later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by keeping interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthening pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members losing a rise in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly forecast for inflation , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure would continue to rise to budget@@ ary income , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation raised by Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time to finance the financing plan to provide cheaper finance for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will now provide € 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on the real income of households remains bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphasized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts down@@ wards for this and next year , compared with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May , are forecast for this and next year .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these news .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover easily after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening becomes even worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the loss of income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover at the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the boy@@ friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June although the Bank said this was expected and will be attracting them in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess of 2 % would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ink , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after fighting the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England admitted that pre @-@ sex pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service through a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to facilitate the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
prevention of prevention ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas significantly .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als , and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable candidates are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , when targeted specifically to vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was acquired , we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ating by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society one step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bench manager with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window looks down from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the programme .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units space for all cutlery and glasses of ju@@ g .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering of engineering went in there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important so that when you push the door , it sli@@ ps very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the size of the soil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t fall in love with electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an elevated square meter number of something standard in something utterly amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confrontation over one of the biggest estate @-@ imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business can be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a store in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family set up je@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 wholesale stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as m@@ alls in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - has about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in has ownership of £ 316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions suggested by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 .
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of in@@ compet@@ ently managing some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance hon@@ ors that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and attor@@ neys held by both parties .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
they took advantage of the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first je@@ ans shop .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anger@@ ed by the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has held back very well even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the Pres@@ idency &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem with President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to fix : poor information coming into the president &apos;s hands .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnos@@ es makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry for unfair report , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election agent Sam N@@ un@@ berg against Poli@@ tico in February . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter custom was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have contained even more ignition sources without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep away from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no @-@ one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump Contro@@ versy .
one part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ors to bring forward du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press releases , especially those with leak@@ y le@@ aks , and that it insi@@ sts on finding out where they came from .
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone had mali@@ ci@@ ously sum@@ mon@@ ed a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the web site of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter on account of ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations and rev@@ oked them in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work , get the dump . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kel@@ ly attempts three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals to get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police across Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after s@@ words are not known by nature , information from the population is hoped for and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting to holiday destinations were hiding , was called Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wi@@ e.com , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online applications could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on the evidence after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on a war foot@@ er who tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Travel@@ ers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Range &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a passage that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw rocks on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travellers just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior with the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which judgment must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made of Birken@@ hof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is built from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof through the then Ambi@@ ance operating company lt@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested parties at the house .
he was right to keep .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Birken@@ hof already there have been building sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for a longer time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room belong to the equipment .
it does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but even on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director of tourism Michael Kr@@ ause .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly .
he reck@@ ons just under one million euros .
the external systems are also placed on the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller will have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
in the past few weeks , the Board accepted the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal to persons familiar with the matter .
the paper presented the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there are already first invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services have accused the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have deliberately interfer@@ ed with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigations should focus on several men who acted as consultants of the Republi@@ can in the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller also took a closer look at more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the centre and investig@@ ates the alleg@@ ation whether the President possibly hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary during the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to test this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether it should be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called ank@@ le bun@@ tings .
most of the times , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be contacted by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite persons to the company under oath .
under CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. Tr@@ um@@ ps were also a consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his long @-@ time election campaign chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the replacement show that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end in order to decide on the charging of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the suspension of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they don &apos;t have anything else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey has said three times that I will not be as@@ cer@@ tained against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this raid , repro@@ aches against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Com@@ ey said before a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under great pressure on account of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release him .
unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the ur@@ ging of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bill dra@@ fts on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the west Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of Berlin &apos;s barely seven @-@ fold size has been solved .
this was announced by the Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton@@ lion and weighs 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now north@@ ward and will probably need two or three years until it has mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear in accordance with research data .
however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
so far , the collap@@ sed col@@ os@@ sus was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f .
ice shelf flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow in the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking was disturbed some years ago .
a complete ice shelf will be dis@@ car@@ ded there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is in danger as well , because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ice bergs does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before .
this could possibly raise sea level , but only slightly , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ ses , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead the demoli@@ tion of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg back to climate change , so in recent decades many of the polar bears of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica covers South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the Antar@@ ctic ice surface has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
over the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated by about three degrees Celsius and thus reaches the areas where the temperature is the quick@@ est .
CD@@ U wants to get house ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Day has inst@@ inct 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have completed their first working day .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were reported for the places to be found this year .
nevertheless , the district is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
there are currently 50 non @-@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among others , the search is carried out by doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
according to the parties &quot; wish , the administration aims to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application scar@@ city of applicants .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before .
other cities hire good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees who leave the service for reasons of disease or age .
so it is high time to act so that there are no more places left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he spent a long time already in the circle of rot@@ ting for a bad surprise when he publicly challenged the human cost ceiling and start@@ led the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be examined that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county government should strive for a house tari@@ ff with the unions , perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher level , which is oriented to career years .
but the tasks of the Circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ ie in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ otic No@@ tice came one day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ ained &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a manner facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed so far to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy suggests that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berliner Ou@@ ter Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the offshore plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , which rewarded the long tribute .
on the second day , there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again there was a view point to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ ps &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ versions brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally - .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ li@@ ga equi@@ ps itself for E @-@ Sport
do the sports stars sit in the future before computer consoles , instead of fighting through the stadium spe@@ eding in wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sports have long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga ver@@ eine , who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two pro@@ s for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire brand new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that there are still some clubs coming up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend FIFA World Federation organizes the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football needs to deal in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be much more present on these markets online than sending the Bundes@@ li@@ gam@@ ann@@ ah to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA will challenge FIFA at a competitive level .
like normal sport , Li@@ gen has long since established itself in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has long dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also train their body and take care of nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to carry on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the highly integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts e @-@ sports a rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tour@@ neys .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
this is little against the € 2.4 billion of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sports are no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many countries are already on the move . &quot; &quot; &quot;
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
the Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports race provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class of instruction , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , the football league football clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in Europe , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
only to decay in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but also to align the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it that only football remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter for the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy push for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through lyrics and calls .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ directed eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better .
she took no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she regre@@ ts completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not occupy the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would be &quot; persecuted &quot; by the realization that she would never attend to her brother &apos;s wedding or be an ante for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case referred to national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang on , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is turn the generator off and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention to Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted of murder by her British resident in Italy in 2007 before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ che : learning from the new mini @-@ l@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern will give the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation won &apos;t hurt .
something was different in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made a tie at his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first mission as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could also interpret the character of the coach .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader from youth players , de@@ pu@@ ties and just from holiday professionals , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those with a lot of herbs that you want to keep in a mood .
those who have been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old te@@ ased as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
to the right rear , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the helm in my hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on de@@ vil@@ s come out to tie the achievements of the Asian trip ( also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus did not neg@@ ate in their first appearance in the Bavarian tri@@ cot .
all this worked out very well .
along with Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy before the defense , Sü@@ le beha@@ ved confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , and addic@@ ts also tried to succeed in building up a couple of times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw following the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but had six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i f@@ arewell after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ ver : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have noticed now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win every game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .

it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs , Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) , is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk about changes in economic policy on T V demand - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Busin@@ esses ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the wishes of the economy , which has all blocked the Lem@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap in the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
the Ministry is still hoping for a planning procedure this year , until 2021 is expected to be right .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the Trier West Bank , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Traffic Council plan .
the goal is to put the circuit into operation in December 2020 , says the ministry spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as has been suggested by Wis@@ ser , to the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label in order to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since 10 years .
in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is fores@@ een for passing master crafts@@ man examination and 2500 Euro , if graduates learn independently within ten years of their master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the planned road construction , quick facts are to be created , at the same time lacking the country at the necessary personnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jan Bell &apos;s chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to date , 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing at the regional mobility sector have only been occup@@ ying 29 vac@@ an@@ cies .
the Chamber of Industry is calling for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
comm@@ enting on calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points out more than 20 million euros more than suggested in the preservation of country roads by 2018 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the existing broad@@ band extension in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies evaluated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a note 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreements .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alization of exhaust f@@ umes ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of bann@@ ing the mighty car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called amor@@ tis@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but return in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Audi &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations with Volkswagen after the authorities acc@@ use Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer respon@@ ds dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft passes through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Bau@@ refer@@ ee wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should shar@@ pen as a worthy wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer the raft went over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los L@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and laughter against the suffering
at times Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most publi@@ cally published carto@@ on@@ ists , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still recording and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he , among other things , proposed himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came in at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures c@@ avor@@ ting in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the table today , working almost ten hours a day .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , cu@@ dd@@ les and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll characters continue to spread widely worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and TV series with his figures for six years .
the main character in the film Cra@@ zy Island is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ man as an opponent .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he tends to focus more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is sil@@ ently produced .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is , because of the conditions that are remin@@ ding of drought and because of the diseases transmitted insects , which scientists and farmers try to find solutions to find large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the farm research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in the past years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and in the autumn a lot more .
this has effects on la@@ ven@@ der life .
there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ des , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ war@@ ves , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ ins said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office that were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and ab@@ domin@@ als suff@@ ice .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to began his office in December 2012 .
among the latter is their editor and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; justice &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wearing T @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times were shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to say about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a somebody or several people are shot on the street or that the grav@@ eyard is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with the blame because he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ els in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , assumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ation problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved publishing hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he willingly admitted he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you are assigned to as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ? why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who like a do@@ ck@@ ster could curse , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine be his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced them to question their own ass@@ umptions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells false , stay away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with J@@ avier happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce employees met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen searched for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who the governor was not trust@@ worthy .
it &apos;s months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the provincial town of the governor .
and there was a group that conducted a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the public prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling institution@@ tional revolution party ( PR@@ I ) which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ profile cases .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier , readers would have viewed the Val@@ dez chron@@ ic@@ le as the best @-@ informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ b@@ bed a few characters and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
journalists have become lou@@ der all over the country by writing down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth .
since then she has asked her to be re @-@ assigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , involved government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media group assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists from the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their homeland or even from the country .
it &apos;s a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for danger .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance involving ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug trade sc@@ ares him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of shooting shops with strip ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the bro@@ ker@@ age , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ als nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s staff followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you remember ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Rhin@@ o of a Canadian mountain labor@@ er have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find out that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as one of the best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ vol@@ au@@ rier , living in the middle of the chal@@ k period before between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil , discovered by him , was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy crude oil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing shell , is probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed interfer@@ ing with the environment and avoiding enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family first made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which indicates that this No@@ vol@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; Brown said .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on evidence about his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died was caught in a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just walk a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it &apos;s at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ some ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was founded on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the en@@ chan@@ ted din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that were prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed ash@@ ore by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater gear of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin st@@ alli@@ ons still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remain@@ ders of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , and his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at its sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ re @-@ long jams and g@@ aff .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first data of the police , between the connections between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably lor@@ ries , were crashing into one another .
the exact number of injured parties initially did not provide any information .
a police spokes@@ man said it was light to moderate injuries .
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re tail@@ oring was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , it also happened on the opposite track to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the hall@@ marks of the automotive technicians , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : concern testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : you don &apos;t have to sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ led .
does the conductor come and w@@ akes an aw@@ k@@ ward or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn ( Deutsche Bahn ) is currently testing the free @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art ticket control .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thereby de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will likely be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and one must have booked an online ticket - which is already done by most passengers anyway .
it also has to be purchased via the app of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : you go to the train , call your ticket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants will receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting on an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can sleep on , keep on working , keep quiet .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should make use of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspections by our train crew , please check in the DB Navigator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marketing Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who regularly drive train know that in addition to delays and missed features , ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because of@@ ten@@ times one does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets in any case .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document needed to be presented .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the section or large room and delays in control of one &apos;s tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further mer@@ gers on the same route have not yet been activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she removed her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people scre@@ aming , and of a man claiming to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed on which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another polic@@ eman said his ri@@ f@@ le and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled about her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and that we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took off her father &apos;s 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance arising from the perspective of people who live in communion and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
although I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp site when activists were waiting for the potential non @-@ charge of the officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business@@ man who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , she was President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not focus their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt Ins@@ ect .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other local people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ara &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person that sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the CC@@ TV cameras have long disappeared in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway during a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bits @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the theme is hardly cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city , the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the gallery makers wish to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we &apos;ve been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm wi@@ fes very happy again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be just low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I don &apos;t think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable to a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually actually comes .
or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery already make it possible to drive all business out of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market place , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - useless building projects in Bit@@ burg don &apos;t have a place anymore .
when the peasant market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room at the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which almost resem@@ ble themselves - which hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st ple@@ aded a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after she publicly disclosed mandatory diplomatic messages on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ form@@ ist and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like a sharp , al@@ beit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hit by the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal bri@@ ews who changed several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President would translate to Over@@ seas judgement and would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , the release of Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a definite reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic dis@@ member@@ ment whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand @-@ foot@@ ed of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ o@@ tide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how surprisingly similar , at least in organic terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , are also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so that &apos;s 30 of those stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic nov@@ ella .
it shows Mann@@ ing as she emerges from the United States &apos;s discipline of discipline such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they cool your speech , then they won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never keep your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when talking about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition in person yet - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed into Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a country @-@ wide ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , arrest warran@@ ts for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ sie ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the stit@@ ches as mur@@ ders while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that they are now being assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ sto@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College told in an email that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insist@@ ed on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip saying that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were them and War@@ ren in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Chief Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA @-@ schedule was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s timet@@ able to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the Organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v admitted problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
these divided the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be further from any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message .
as of now only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ine anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and gri@@ ev@@ ance hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent C @-@ suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure staff commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can drill down why .
companies come to see that there must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity after an overview .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conversion has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent will send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the Chief Executive Officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has employed Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair internship - quicker identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke down because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
cent earned $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers claimed $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just st@@ akes in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that their voices heard and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve yields if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
indeed , if a company asks employee after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ ge on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle moments are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the water man football center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players and has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 7 : 15 pm to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons passed in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to do 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ otted on , they &apos;re great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been ki@@ cked with pe@@ eling posts , which will be a safety net behind a door@@ post will be no easy task .
brother @-@ player should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our safety , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far from thinking that people are renting a room there and then setting up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on car park 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake messages from third parties and then show their results in the original article , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors that may display results of the fact audit from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in advance of the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly remove h@@ asser@@ tive post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook reported in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides understanding which stories are challenged by fac@@ tual audi@@ tors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes in his news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
create a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ ies and 1980 @-@ ies .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat at the irri@@ gation river valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome p@@ ou@@ ch &quot; ) it all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke to coun@@ try@@ men , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing what possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ er@@ ship that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery which was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ elles are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a gar@@ aun@@ er , always paying off debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to promote land@@ se . &quot;
after the end of his essay in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ ams experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ gl@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret by Nelson Ar@@ tz .
at the end of August , it is said to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think of this ( of course ! ) , &quot; they write on their website that was released yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as Bad Honne@@ f citizens we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action deals with more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in competition with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f is worth a middle five @-@ digit amount due to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) will advise against reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the pres@@ idency of the He@@ ads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defense , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the discussions .
these were the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were allegedly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the overthrow attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; giving him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cleanse the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dis@@ comfort in military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ tu@@ bing ban for soldiers , the paper wrote .
in any case , the large @-@ scale teaching of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan ordered more than 7@@ 3@@ 95 servants , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times , they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ ron@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving forces to Islam@@ ize the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a named officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , warned the Turkish army to be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it fores@@ ees reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill shall be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by changing the way citizens are dealt with Green Cards from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will help candidates who speak English who have financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate the circuit for racing shuttle
over the past few months , the future of the shuttle service has been fought over and over again - now it is supposed to go quite fast .
even before the end of the year , on the ailing road , on which the tourist train runs , is to be built .
according to the traffic ministry , construction work will begin on the track in order to secure the future of the platform sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is especially important for tourism , &quot; explained Deputy Secretary Klaus Koch@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
he paid the cost of repair the route to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in future by the country , is currently finally agreed , declared expi@@ atory .
the ministry and the south Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; expi@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the race @-@ platform shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , during a pilot operation it has been tested whether the route is used by many people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come .
yes indeed .
sex robots are a big deal right now .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye colour to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford wife look progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah is disturbing one of the most .
true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy used on his website with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; they say on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their formation and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R recognizes their increasing popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ aks out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have attacked women sexually .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ och@@ ed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing hin@@ ders on independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the words of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized U.S. voters have split even families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all supposed to make our filter bags burst .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which they had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the pres@@ ent@@ ment of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we talk of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer be ki@@ cked off .
there is , however , an even more horri@@ fic long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing which suddenly appears in comparison to its standards as the notion of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact appear to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ mati@@ zing music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that in fact , Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - The Them@@ es @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40 &apos;s and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , this week , I was forced to review my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us , for the second time , has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to present this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that it is too si@@ ghted .
the National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the acqu@@ itt@@ al could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger &apos;s schools , the four @-@ thous@@ anders from F@@ arch@@ ers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , senior school manager An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle to grow up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lively Sch@@ ar conducted a musical entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken from him sm@@ itten , and the eagle stretched out its wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken @-@ dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ggles , the cylinders wore to make the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle is standing for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said teacher An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wanted each one @-@ four@@ thous@@ ander to feel accepted in his new school .
it was followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who always jumps into classes of classes and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ bers are now over , declared the class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she did not leave her students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door wat@@ chers .
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season .
there was great joy with the children .
eight first @-@ class players have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally rooted people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and impose considerable fin@@ es on anyone who is not intended to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry stated that the court can impose a fine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
euros @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory update previously applies only to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced quick implementation in the coming months , but has not yet been called an exact date .
Daimler has reported to write every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be carried out in its framework .
how long will the retro@@ fitting take ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , according to S@@ met@@ anine .
is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared this .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
so far , there have been no losses in value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony among President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ ors .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the winner of the award winner Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , announced that he would wai@@ ve his participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that weighs on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her view clearer .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ k City Engineer , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work is still a lot of fun to him as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has been submitted to the requirements profile so far .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
it should be enough time for famili@@ ar@@ isation with respect to the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach acts as the lower building law authority for the administration community , the applicant must present corresponding statements .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be possible to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but the proximity of citizens is important to the city and to himself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , a number of significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park are about to happen .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the renovation of the stadium is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the job here is fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of room for a city building master .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener there can be re@@ acted flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; keep an eye on what is pure &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going town construction master emphasizes .
the city Builder is responsible anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of experience in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
W@@ acker hopes that his successor will stay for a long time : &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .
those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker should , according to the city of Has@@ lach , have a completed degree of studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , construction management planning , basic exploitation , administration of urban properties , urban farm with building yard and urban gar@@ dening , as well as the Lower Struc@@ tural Authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown on cables : closed on the south
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators look out from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
close to the crime scene , a pink wheel@@ er and a bike rider had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a city of Lus@@ ati@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator could have put himself in great danger and end@@ lessly je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail freight transport , even more pat@@ rons of the railway customer could come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum can be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway track could be led without obstruc@@ tions .
almost ten passenger trains had fallen on Friday morning , two of which were concerned with long distance traffic .
freight trains were not cancelled , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study reveals exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while people are usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends to become too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote a toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el movement if the same system also affects people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same stem , which had not been accommod@@ ated separately .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial atoms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacteria species found in the mice were found with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ancing cells like mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans like mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can potentially lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ pro@@ visi@@ oning @-@ Asia tour of the blues , and managed only 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Boeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paints &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ igan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be on the radar screens .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire in the party headquarters , but no counter @-@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election warri@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with an increasing horror .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described with head@@ winds in the approach .
there were sur@@ charges .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green cannot simply go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Euro MP Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has thrown the government off into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green German CEO Michael Kell@@ ner urged the back@@ sliding low @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must return her mandate immediately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive and El@@ ection Manager of the Green Party to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD election milit@@ ant si@@ ghs when the new job message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , former SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , faces the CD@@ U without their own government majority after the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ ung &apos;s green de@@ pu@@ ties .
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comrades cal@@ med down at that time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that became the case - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the pi@@ v@@ ot , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ mp@@ ing up in the weeks after .
then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD land@@ lady , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made quite everything wrong , which can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critic@@ ised for a long time .
sum@@ ming survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation during the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not concealed either comrades in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him because they promised Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
at the same time , Wei@@ l is no fault of the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Sax@@ on gre@@ ens .
and no Schulz at all .
at times , comrades make an effort to keep their own ranks closed .
her anger appe@@ aled to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the back@@ sliding parliamentary @-@ president T@@ westen .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen presents her own career interests on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but has been elected to parliament by the state board of the Sax@@ on Green Party , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD &apos;s Lower Saxony as the leading candidate to the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career presents of a future CD@@ U member are fal@@ si@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for town core III
those who want to stay in the years old house can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg City Development informed them on Wednesday in sentim@@ ents .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what was happening so far .
since 1991 , it has been present in sensitive areas of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
at that time , in the re@@ development area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the subsi@@ dy .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; finally , it is important to promote the internal development and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I received the information from the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the subsi@@ dy amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest from the community .
how is a restructuring area created ?
one will , so Sch@@ in@@ dler proceed to investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening they represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal government programme in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be done obj@@ ectively , that is per plot , carried out .
the re@@ development area would then finally be set as statute .
the grant period for the funds has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the inventory can only be carried out , within the framework of which the participants involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the amend@@ ment should be made as soon as possible so that the restoration can begin in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every Commune had to carry out the predicted preliminary examinations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about evaluating the urban planning of the city and deciding when it is being renovated and what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann herself would come up again and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project involved .
for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it deals among other things about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Ar@@ rival &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , parti@@ tioning and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out when operating rooms are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphasized that the distribution of the funding means functioning according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes , first grin@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funding for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country to be equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between th@@ um@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and a dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the bill costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars according to the military that has been left to the TI@@ ME magazine .
the Green @-@ White Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was on display in addition to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a fire truck from Wisconsin and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi for@@ kli@@ ft .
the White House &apos;s military office required the presence of the helicopter in a question@@ able order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn according to the chron@@ ic@@ le of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Military Commander for Aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning for the event at 3@@ pm and so long until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
the recordings made available by TI@@ ME did not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event might viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sound like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet served in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters units also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have any budget labels for the Pres@@ idency , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
record of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but account for the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week things produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut state are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was not clear whether he inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for class and stability at the S@@ V subur@@ ban rail , imports from the high North are primarily concerned .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress reviewed some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US def@@ end@@ ant .
after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors from the O@@ MV , which are jointly with other European companies , are worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Refu@@ ge@@ e Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is huge .
however , it is too early for an estimation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city also organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city day care centers , the clock is turned back .
on 1st September Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the department of youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh boiled water .
the city operates 46 nur@@ series in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children , who are served 45 hours of the week , have lunch at the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ al @-@ time forces have kitchen service from 1 September onwards : they heat up the delivered foods , add salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give away food , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
the size - there are two groups as well as sev@@ ent@@ een facilities - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also suitable for children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff .
apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , this variation - the separation of kitchen performance - also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city than the most economical .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all the members of the society , including the women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said hundreds of women will be candidates in the Provin@@ ces . three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban has issued threats against a choice trial which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , for the first time , the elections are handed over peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Hay@@ som , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

men trying to eradic@@ ate 13 years old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to the police information , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the cul@@ pr@@ its tried to grab the girl &apos;s phone and the necklace of the girl , which was ab@@ u@@ sive .

G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant at managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has out@@ weigh@@ ed the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ a location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces plan@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies next to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called for &quot; concerns to voice that funding for modernization of production lines is not promoted . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ a is deeply concerned with our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ a received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB @-@ representatives at T@@ oll@@ a , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continuously check our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than £ 5 million in our ra@@ bies , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ a as a place of production . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not fail to pursue N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the record of the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous stamp , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for $ 89 million .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the world &apos;s most expensive player and the world &apos;s highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catalan board insist@@ ed that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but three years ago , the football world was warned by the PS@@ G President prior to this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to subscribe to one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown killer has deliberately thrown off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle &apos;s disgu@@ ise of more than 200 euros .

the police are looking for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year old came from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW at 7.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the pride of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the crash barrier .
in the passenger car , damage was made .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident report , it can be good that the driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now call for witnesses of the incident and the driver of the accident , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication with the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would greatly serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the proceedings .
on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that when reporting on violence against Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee , was striking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of the daily work experience and prepares the public opinion to keep that for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go to the church and this is a bound fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows are a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse cases , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take protection for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber from the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were subjected to ab@@ uses between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot; 67 domains were ab@@ used sexually .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been used .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even in spite of violence , even bring positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen George R@@ atz@@ inger expressed his opinion .
Mr. H@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence of protection at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ an and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more tangible for the latter when a cathedral sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is there at all .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside his sphere of influence .
at best , one can pre@@ tend that it is too late or first attempts have not taken seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to tears of rage .
the fact that he not only kno@@ cked on chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the floor , but also gave ear @-@ cow@@ ards and drew too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the question@@ able times , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents and teachers .
do you still know such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is true of course .
one asks oneself if it is not with his acquain@@ tance and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed on him .
many who never understood him are still working dili@@ gently on the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
the media reports much about the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger laid on any involvement or co @-@ recognition in the final report regarding sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no . no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a concerned representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in clari@@ fying sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators in a certain degree .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; with regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that they have opened up more urgent or clearer , or even more , than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , teachers of faith , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students and / or their environment affected in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
thus he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to display .
therefore , there is no reason to associate a good name with these adverse crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former master builder Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; looking away &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely an abuse of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents during the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the head of the Cathedral Choir .
all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were really har@@ assed and mal@@ igned and suffering from them , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boys first to see when they were already on the cathedral @-@ level gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on this , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; primary school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ ic &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , even re@@ connect positive memories with it . &quot;
at the most , the blame remains to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger spar@@ ed the ears from the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the grammar school , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the punishment is still practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , it recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as audi@@ tors had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took possession of a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
for him , too , it was difficult to estimate where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permitted limit was really exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he had always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent child souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice .
this is all terrible and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I have to take protection for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. drawing ear @-@ cow@@ ards and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regensburg period did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduce in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of Prü@@ m sentence also available for speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
nevertheless , I did not at all hide from the fact that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , you don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met George R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamentally ben@@ evol@@ ent , deeply believing and sav@@ our@@ y people , of which one could not imagine that he could also do something in a fly .
I regularly get into contact with him , like many former dom@@ ici@@ sts today , 23 years after his é@@ mig@@ rating , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are thus un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally in the minority .
most of the Cathedral spar@@ rows are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able dis@@ respect , to which they still look up today and which they down@@ right ad@@ ore .
and please , once again quite clearly , all you have been accused of are education methods that were then on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
