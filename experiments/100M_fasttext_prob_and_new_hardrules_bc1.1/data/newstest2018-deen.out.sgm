<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former cause of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official card promotes exciting stories by day.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, which had to be exciting, because the car-navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportale of Bavaria within the state government, are anything but up to date - but very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called original papers were incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian surveying management, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon sought an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally stripped off with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Messaging Management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The document sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like any other, found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison between earlier / today is most impressive, for example, the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was commissioned 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as Munich's city district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: zooming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flurries from the so-called "primeval" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small parcels do not occupy more farmers there today, but gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the document, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der Lünen" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based circle-ray-asylum was founded" "" "At the Auer Ventilate" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was head of the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the ranking of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the staff to employ violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Director of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, there was first room, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular power station in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianism are now meeting in the area of the former prison.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings dating back to the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenberg, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn family route takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens' rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls for Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourian to take special care while traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people harder to prosecute discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities that disproportionate minorities, prompted the group to publish the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited precedents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sander died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during his trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri General Public Prosecutor's Office indicating that black motorists in the state are employed 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and coworkers about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring money or make their relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime report program, which classify the state in terms of the number of such violations in the country's 16th rank.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel warning for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration laws that will oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people on account of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial guidance following the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Soft-fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the rectangular court of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fisherbach CDU suburban met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, fed 40 dairy cows and as many young and housed in five apartments Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is for him an alternative marketing pathway for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales come to the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischbach, he described the soft-fence project as" "" "elementary importance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area provides a lot of work and much needs to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental business and used this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not carry out a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the soft-fence project and is glad about the leader support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operation," "" "said Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of support</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which must not be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half has been promoted over leader, a quarter bearing the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job without farmers and women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Regional Development Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state funding of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor system marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the protracted area must not be hauled (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened with reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fisherman's soft-down project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure is 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the suggestions of the president to drastically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not accept the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatowowners and liberty-hedgehogs had lynched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base has been added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to later added, and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the begging words of Lazarus, the only ones in whom a state not only invites the old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "poor waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives to bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh stumbled upon something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to lighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotsmen belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the United Kingdom Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship grid will" "" "make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain from the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her talk was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in its fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsmen are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Schottlands hitherto best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season, which included victory with the British team Trials and Anniversary games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships, being the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "extremely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also medals and finals will be involved.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from the domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shrinks at criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union chased him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to degenerate his hair-free head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of grolls or spammers or hassers-filled people who wave the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profits.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what the governor's associates described as" "" "concentrated Spam-attack" "" "would probably be called" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook Era makes it easy to note a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cloths or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County changed the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington's time, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter pens hit his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more titanic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk first reveals a different, less glamorous figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk has frequently promoted more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk now clears: 63.000 reorders have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that only non-binding reservations are available.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such non-binding reservations occurred, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">By 2018, all models will be combined - 500,000 by 2020, one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, we expect to expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, unprecedented production lines without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">If it comes to major delays, then the non-binding of reservations may become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint which had been raised against his prior spot in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is a term that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">"" "Pruitt announced in June that he will delay the observance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" "" "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed to blocking or delaying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruit regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the Ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not set to vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York General Prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of States who had accused the EPA this week, said the group intends to uphold the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius system is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Wirelbuch. count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the nearby parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As described from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the community settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage came from the early medieval church right.</seg>
<seg id="477">A bishop who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this Church of its own.</seg>
<seg id="478">As a result, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the Bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two were dismembered on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded in 1692 for the first time, but was later to be released during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were hammered and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church-mill and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years of the history of the church.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius system as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As promoter, the friends and promoters of Tumlingen invite to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16, to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium of Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local ruler, Hartmut Romann, speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the serenade a trunk outside the cemetery takes place.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organisers are setting out the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of importance for tumors and listeners.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim defends itself" "" "does not see any legal requirement for construction and therefore has turned to the councillor." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim defends" "" "has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at that time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent" "" "parsing" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days before - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve of it because of a molded fault.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of scheduled legal requirements, the authorised permit is still unlawful and therefore to take back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of" "" "Boisheim defends himself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "Erkens:" "" "at this point the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the relevant letters have been made in the circle Viersen since last week," declared a spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes it as an occasion to test the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not wish to express itself in regards to the argumentation of the association "Boisheim Soloist."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a NEW subsidiary, is planning the construction of four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company in which the town Viersen is indirectly involved, has concluded lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares large grounds.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - equivalent to approximately one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re is planning to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max capacity works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They are working at several places in their voluntary year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in Steinfurt in the furniture fair, once a week I help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a nice, wide range that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-called volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I did a high school graduation.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully broke off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized that it's wrong for me and I want to do something different, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked what you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it is locally, at the focal point maybe also, really is.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I have collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably in Jugendamt Herne, a social worker education and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Isn't it unusual to have several different locations during the Volunteer Service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Amount: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends on where you are doing your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It can be done from old people to youth work - in all facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">It was very varied with me.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon supervision.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that provoked me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.</seg>
<seg id="708">Unlike in civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">Quantity: well, it's not about calculating statics.</seg>
<seg id="710">You always have other people's heads, each with a different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee asks if a youth who has been taken out of the family - you must always deal with it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you had no reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Amount: I'm not the guy.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">Much love, much kindness.</seg>
<seg id="717">There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British training group Pearson said on Friday that they will dismantle more than 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job cuts, which CEO John Fallon mainly announced for the end of 2018 and at the start of 2019, will be added to his previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">At a third cost-cutting programme, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May in order to revive a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan in the first six months of 2017 there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>

<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack, since the US-led troops displaced the Taliban in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">The violence asserts the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump is considering raising the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="737">Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, their policy and in particular in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks this addition.</seg>

<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be completed by internet.</seg>

<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later, the Starpath Ticket will be extended by train.</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the star path, the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.</seg>

<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come to the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to guarantee stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly restructured.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges run over the Lauterbach river.</seg>

<seg id="923">The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach requires a particular sense of finger-sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="924">This is because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the works.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the guiding organization controlling the European game has the power to forbid teams from access to the prestigious champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">"" "" "" "financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to show that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses." ""</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid $222 million ($262 million) to extract Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar is signing and bringing him into a galaxy of other stars, in the face of the financing of the team by the rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must be subject to legitimate income sources, which allow them to reach the break-even point in their business related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who in their quest for success had taken enormous debts, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, its UEFA successor, Aleksander Cslin, continues to be deterred from excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for billing according to the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the selling prices for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by businesses connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, UEFA would not count it as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship value was set up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments made by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar's World Cup will be held and such a maneuver for UEFA regulatory authorities is easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymar's transfer, announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "" "" "the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published." ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a beneficiary for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal manager Arsene Kiesinger, whose association is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," "" "said Wenger on Thursday." ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">Over the past few years, Chocolate Frey made Board Chocolate for Swiss Life.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">"" "Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a report from the newspaper" "" "Nordwestschweiz" "" "on Friday." ""</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white wrapped top-up panels of 14 grams each year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The Swiss authorities did not want to disclose information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders in line with "Nordwestschweiz" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a shooter manufacturer it is a prestigious job.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are involved in the new tendering process.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract for spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sthere, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board its flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before joining a contract with Migros, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo at the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey two and a half years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-th years, for the 90-year Grunge period (as the Vordsmen David Wain and Michael Showalter the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" functioned surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd lobster (it contained original history for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">As they stiffened at the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny kids that grow up - nevertheless they managed to regain the last part of the weather.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the watering can principle, including a riff to the Stalker movies of the 90-s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("Die hand that cries the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character can rummage through an Apple-Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novautor, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-vicious plot involved in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's great fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's moustache of "singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random delusions that could heat this franchise as a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," which will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon meanwhile recalls another kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with his east-west-west rally-iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy, created by Brian Gatebood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director, gives a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulica whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt can be synchronized in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, how Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides for a decent play 'Finding the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan Mask is involved - that it often plays as a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," which was edited down to a lower length, could better deliver Agitprop-Satire because Gregor and Iosef continued to visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can do anything for food for a money.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike against drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in beating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office was informed on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 complainants were arrested at the age of 25 years and 77, and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the functionaries secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">In the case of simultaneous raids in Italy, two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">In the action Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The Mafia's members are accused of organised crime of drugs, violent acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">That is why the Grand deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four clerks from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">In particular, Italian nationals with a close relation to the Italian mafia went into the spotlight of the investigations.</seg>

<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England leader Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to facilitate the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prevention of prevention (prep) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep reduces the HIV transmission in infection-prone areas significantly.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable candidates are identified, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bench manager with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"" "" "" "before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," "" "says Joanne." ""</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window looks down from Retrouvius over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the programme.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all cutlery and glasses of jug.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a little engineering of engineering went in there," "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important so that when you push the door, it slips very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the size of the soil." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't fall in love with electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an elevated square meter number of something standard in something utterly amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a confrontation over one of the biggest estate-imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business can be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a store in the Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family set up jeans and grew into a chain of 160 wholesale stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - has about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin has ownership of £316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions suggested by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance honors that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affirmvits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and attorneys held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and in the early seventies bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, where Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "Paul says," "" "angered by the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has held back very well even though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the Presidency's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem with President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to fix: poor information coming into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnoses makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry for unfair report, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "said the former election agent Sam Nunberg against Politico in February." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps's Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant lobbying." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps's Twitter custom was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trumps tweets would have contained even more ignition sources without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep away from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no-one has consistently been able to prevent Trump Controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">One part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors to bring forward dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press releases, especially those with leaky leaks, and that it insists on finding out where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone had maliciously summoned a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the web site of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter on account of chicanes or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had uttered false accusations and revoked them in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork, get the dump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1st March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof through the then Ambiance operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at the time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was right to keep.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Birkenhof already there have been building shuttings in front of the entrance for a longer time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors have been torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bath tubs are removed from the rooms.</seg>

<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>

<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or businesspeople should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Issuer sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller will have appointed a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In the past few weeks, the Board accepted the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal to persons familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper presented the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence services have accused the Kremlin for a long time to have deliberately interfered with the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations should focus on several men who acted as consultants of the Republican in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller also took a closer look at more and more trumps private and business.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump has personally moved into the centre and investigates the allegation whether the President possibly hindered the judiciary during the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to test this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called ankle buntings.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the times, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be contacted by the public prosecutor in order to invite persons to the company under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Under CNN, invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. Trumps were also a consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his long-time election campaign chief Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the replacement show that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end in order to decide on the charging of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the suspension of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the subject gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good because they don't have anything else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he didn't know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But I usually work in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates all measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI boss James Comey has said three times that I will not be ascertained against the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was first used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this raid, reproaches against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "in June, Comey said before a senate committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure on account of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release him.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special promoter of the Congress such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bill drafts on Thursday, after which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the west Antarctic a gigantic iceberg of Berlin's barely seven-fold size has been solved.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tonlion and weighs 5800 square kilometres, is now northward and will probably need two or three years until it has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear in accordance with research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">So far, the collapsed colossus was part of the Larsen-C-Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow in the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete ice shelf will be discarded there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Shelf is in danger as well, because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and ice bergs does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly raise sea level, but only slightly, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapses, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this giant iceberg back to climate change, so in recent decades many of the polar bears of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica covers South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic ice surface has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has heated by about three degrees Celsius and thus reaches the areas where the temperature is the quickest.</seg>

<seg id="1561">According to the parties "wish, the administration aims to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application scarcity of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars sit in the future before computer consoles, instead of fighting through the stadium speeding in wind and weather?</seg>

<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first Bundesliga vereine, who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be much more present on these markets online than sending the Bundesligamannah to Asia once a year.</seg>

<seg id="1629">And in Asia, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has long dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>

<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW president said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralization of exhaust fumes ejected by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of banning the mighty car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called amortisation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but return in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1761">Last month, the former Head of Thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations with Volkswagen after the authorities accuse Audi to have installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer responds disproportionately to Volkswagen's win.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the farm research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in the past years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and in the autumn a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on lavender life.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office that were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominals suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto began his office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editor and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "said Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "justice" hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wearing T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is still more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we mistrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times were shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to say about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa somebody or several people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the blame because he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the children, assumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxication problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved publishing hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to live on," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who like a dockster could curse, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for the routine be his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "you don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happened." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the Riodoce employees met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen searched for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen, who the governor was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It's months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has concentrated on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on the state expenditures concentrated on the provincial town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that conducted a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the public prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling institutiontional revolution party (PRI) which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption due to high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one in which a son of El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have viewed the Valdez chronicle as the best-informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder all over the country by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then she has asked her to be re-assigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he founded on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil, discovered by him, was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy crude oil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a changing shell, is probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed interfering with the environment and avoiding enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family first made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by eating meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which indicates that this Novolaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous dinosaur predators must have been the chalk time," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on evidence about his life, including his conserved bowel content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur when he died was caught in a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chalk time." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just walk a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it's at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, million years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was founded on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the enchanted dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that were protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed ashore by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater gear of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin stallions still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, between the connections between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, among them probably lorries, were crashing into one another.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of injured parties initially did not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="1977">A police spokesman said it was light to moderate injuries.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>

<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased via the app of the railway, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking.</seg>

<seg id="2007">So you can sleep on, keep on working, keep quiet.</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document needed to be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the section or large room and delays in control of one's tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolls through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweeten the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She removed her cell phone to return to Tweet on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed on which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11pm she took off her father's 6-year-old daughter and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance arising from the perspective of people who live in communion and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning "on the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2049">Although I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp site when activists were waiting for the potential non-charge of the officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came from Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently said in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not focus their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt Insect.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other local people followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we speak," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrara's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community coming together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrara's life as she falls in love and marries her wife." ""</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrara's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012, have shaped the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian area splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While proponents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city, the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be concluded.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>

<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market place during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually actually comes.</seg>

<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which almost resemble themselves - which hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst pleaded a 35-year custodial sentence after she publicly disclosed mandatory diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Stresemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformist and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg was created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was hit by the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal briews who changed several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President would translate to Overseas judgement and would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, the release of Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable paths to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a definite reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the "automatic dismemberment whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footed of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how surprisingly similar, at least in organic terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, are also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories so that's 30 of those stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novella.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she emerges from the United States's discipline of discipline such as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2155">This was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources start-up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to address surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and grievance hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent C-suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure staff commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that there must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity after an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Conversion has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent will send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has recorded regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves inethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has employed Convercent for over a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internship - quicker identified and addressed.</seg>

<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employee Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen broke down because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent earned $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers claimed $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects are just stakes in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that their voices heard and that the work that you do is worthwhile, then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields if their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks employee after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow, employees ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so rett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to re-organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-ies and 1980-ies.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat at the irrigation river valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a coshaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says enthusiastically.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome pouch") it all seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke to countrymen, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>

<seg id="2376">According to the traffic ministry, construction work will begin on the track in order to secure the future of the platform shuttles in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is especially important for tourism," explained Deputy Secretary Klaus Kochl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">He paid the cost of repair the route to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country overtakes 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in future by the country, is currently finally agreed, declared expiatory.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The ministry and the south Thuringia railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "this is the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated" "", "expil." ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">As a result, the race-platform shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, during a pilot operation it has been tested whether the route is used by many people to order them regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also very bumpy in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big deal right now.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey at the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye colour to the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a Stepford wife look progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah is disturbing one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True Companion Roxxxy used on his website with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" they say on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR recognizes their increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time where women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stoched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots do not represent real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing hinders on independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the words of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized U.S. voters have split even families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to make our filter bags burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican kinship with which they had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is in another context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the presentment of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we talk of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his bibs will no longer be kicked off.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump republicans normalize the right wing which suddenly appears in comparison to its standards as the notion of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump in fact appear to be a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatizing music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that in fact, Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - The Themes-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40's and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week, I was forced to review my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius, for the second time, has left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">On account of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius asserted that he held his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to present this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say that it is too sighted.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the acquittal could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslak City Engineer, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still a lot of fun to him as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has been submitted to the requirements profile so far.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">It should be enough time for familiarisation with respect to the regular periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as the lower building law authority for the administration community, the applicant must present corresponding statements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not be possible to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity of citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who want to bury Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, have a completed degree of studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study reveals exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While people are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends to become too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote a tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movement if the same system also affects people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same stem, which had not been accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial atoms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacteria species found in the mice were found with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The Green-White Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was on display in addition to a Maine Yacht, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a Mississippi forklift.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House's military office required the presence of the helicopter in a questionable order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn according to the chronicle of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the Commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the Deputy Military Commander for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on July 17th at 7 o'clock in the morning for the event at 3pm and so long until the grass was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings made available by TIME did not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have any budget labels for the Presidency, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the US Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D amounts to 24.380 USD per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Record of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but account for the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not fail to pursue Neymar's persecution after having issued an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous stamp, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for $89 million.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication with the German press agency, he received an apology from former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that when reporting on violence against Domspatzen is measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that "shameful and shameful acts" would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee, was striking.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of denying the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of the daily work experience and prepares the public opinion to keep that for normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would like to go to the church and this is a bound fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "blows are a normal educational tool" "" "in her youth," "" "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the reminder "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take protection for Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber from the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were subjected to abuses between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility." 67 domains were abused sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been used.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even in spite of violence, even bring positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen George Ratzinger expressed his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence of protection at the Regensburger Domspatzen" (Regensburger Domspatzen) "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as cholerian and perfectionist, which became more tangible for the latter when a cathedral spatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is there at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool were also expropriated outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can pretend that it is too late or first attempts have not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as" "" "redemption," "" "" heaven "" "" and "" "" better world. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">So also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony, describes it as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to tears of rage.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he not only knocked on chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also gave ear-cowards and drew too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the questionable times, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, this is true of course.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One asks oneself if it is not with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media reports much about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen station in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger laid on any involvement or co-recognition in the final report regarding sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no. no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said a concerned representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a certain degree.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: "with regard to sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that they have opened up more urgent or clearer, or even more, than to their parents, dormitory leaders, teachers of faith, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "the students and / or their environment affected in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate a good name with these adverse crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "non-violence" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former master builder Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge melange of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the cathedral-sparrows, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents during the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the Cathedral Choir.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were really harassed and maligned and suffering from them, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boys first to see when they were already on the cathedral-level gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject of "primary school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacic" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even reconnect positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the blame remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger spared the ears from the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the grammar school, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out" "" "that in the pre-school the punishment is still practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, it recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as auditors had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took possession of a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">For him, too, it was difficult to estimate where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permitted limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent child souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take protection for Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. drawing ear-cowards and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of Prüm sentence also available for speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all hide from the fact that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, you don't even make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "what kind of people did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met George Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamentally benevolent, deeply believing and savoury people, of which one could not imagine that he could also do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get into contact with him, like many former domicists today, 23 years after his émigrating, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are thus unequivocally in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Cathedral sparrows are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable disrespect, to which they still look up today and which they downright adore.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clearly, all you have been accused of are education methods that were then on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the occupation would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
