28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local grocery store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , and distributed the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department stated that death was classified as murder and the investigation is running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS Sender K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had secured his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things were finally going uphill for him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said that he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; joining his family with his family was to always cook something to prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the support phone of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or stuck out from outside labels , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at her as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of a TV with a loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they dar@@ ed to go home at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed @-@ trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with that the riding career ended already again .
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he moved with his family to the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ar for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards for the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the Sports Py@@ ramid .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first award @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the participants include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ book Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza award ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps Econom@@ ies Com@@ par@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are at odds with tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton lies on a prin@@ ci@@ pled , rather philosophical difference .
the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt small and warn about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be completely different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is going to mas@@ sively re@@ tract regulations , and he stands strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
in that one must be invested , says Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost verb@@ ally .
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical party wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so on Tr@@ ump , party @-@ internal discussions might come up .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more pronounced .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , Clinton is planning to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and demand : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign either .
at the same time , both parties do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , says Clinton .
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ attle , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics argue that the budget deficit will only be greater .
on the other side , Clinton standing at least by the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby who is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social relief services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for single @-@ minded women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs brought up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not even as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the flight , this continues .
&quot; for instance , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
whoever believes that as soon as they acc@@ use Germany , the end tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and worst ab@@ used .
she estimates that about 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to talk openly about what they have experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees .
on the question , if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the accommodation of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone wing@@ ed women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are some common shel@@ ters or houses for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
as much as the women feel this need of protection , one can read the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new employment campaigns
representatives of the resident doctors called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have met ministers to respond to the concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistants and medical students voted on the refusal of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; persist@@ ently quiet , &quot; causing the contract to be rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begin in early September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistants were on strike this year six times , the first complete failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of B@@ MA &apos;s assistants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny myself that Ankara is the most willing to make this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sm@@ alli@@ ed and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as though there had never been anything bad .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s eman@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the launching of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was arous@@ ed .
Putin announced and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia .
the crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
building up the right to rebuild will be difficult if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious alleg@@ ations were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan would have benefited his own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting only took place because Putin received an excuse from President Erdo@@ gan to hear him .
Russia could win a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire lie clearly in hand .
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was removed nearly his office after a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , national television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ č@@ sti put it like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West since it respon@@ ds to its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continuing gru@@ dge is coming across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state in Ankara won with security a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; in Russia and Turkey : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel bad and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have mat@@ ured the issue .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey threw off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State would at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the CEO of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role .
Scotland &apos;s Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Win@@ ner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized headquarters and the listing of IP@@ Os will be changed to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for retail banking , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment stamp and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a Bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bench for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these trademarks again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves his 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives it 3,000 prize
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he made a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Ju@@ dge , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that this happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the jubil@@ ation when he brings victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys hit the milestone in obstacle races - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a recru@@ iting career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have inspired fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already brought 6,000 profits if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already had nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat@@ race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six @-@ month ban , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t been at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to at least 5@@ 0,@@ 000@@ th year of life .
Russia Putin ur@@ ges Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed Deputy Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence in many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin it is said that without stating reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s has ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who since 2012 was Ivan@@ ovo &apos;s deputy , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in Tall@@ inn , Est@@ onian capital , he graduated at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the head of the protocol and Head of Staff of the Government Staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state with respect to bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest friends of Vladimir Putin for a long time and works for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but in spite of the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who was once promoted as a potential president , at one time wants to direct Russian environmental policy - has met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated job - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust it for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
it was once assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term Putin &apos;s term would viol@@ ate the constitution .
but this post was taken by Putin &apos;s other closest ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced its dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the statement by ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled transmission of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that 75 ﬁ@@ sh could deal with Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were sp@@ elled out by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lid blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 different be@@ vel ropes .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
today , Minister of Economy , Kei@@ th Brown , paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total deck is in place and the final section of Dec@@ ks gets a concrete das@@ h for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ proof high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the extension of the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards with an incline of approx . 3 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delicate , because the tolerances on which the team works were tiny - on each side they just ru@@ ined a few milli@@ metres . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown at Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue service struck by 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert on Friday after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and presented the worst to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of reach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bo@@ je suspended without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ed off the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone is watching over these men today .
seriously injured - man pi@@ cks up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothing , he called his mother .
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the ex @-@ life @-@ companion of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old chu@@ cked his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds favor@@ ably priced apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party : investors should be put into duty a lot more strongly in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 inexpensive dwell@@ ings over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but contro@@ versy is inevitable .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group President Christoph Vi@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in agreement with the Gre@@ ens : anyone wanting to build on urban surfaces must pay 20 percent of all homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the inventory .
the big issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann said : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing construction programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few prec@@ ep@@ ts as possible .
the left intends to make even tough@@ er support for investors .
despite this , as Brat@@ mann said , the situation on the housing market is escal@@ ating .
if the plan of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete , as the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do we compensate for the loss of other around 1300 low @-@ priced apartments , whose promotion will continue in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning oli@@ tical spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now buy running bin@@ dings from the city .
in addition , it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the west city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 dwell@@ ings could be brought back to the price range for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased again , the aim of the so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ fare is to be removed .
there should be no more concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens count on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more sites for single @-@ family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that a compromise can be found ?
Pok@@ é@@ mon go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
at first , the time on the screen was limited to television , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later came a cartoon series , playing cards , and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many other pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons tracking with a GPS and as soon as they have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when it was younger , joined the tur@@ key and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day .
Car@@ di@@ grams , an app for Apple Watch who followed 35@@ ,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after market launch , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look el@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
if you exercise regularly , you can reduce your chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always there are also gru@@ es@@ ome game @-@ destro@@ yers who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should I do ?
there has been a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit had previously been able to track our activity , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all the way .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed on Thursday for the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team amer@@ ou@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es are sculp@@ ting at the Winter Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success is the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the past three years , winning 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that the 1984 Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
they expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between their and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single @-@ part competition of women during the Winter Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the party coordinator of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insist@@ ed , during their long journey to the top , never planned to have the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is geared to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was easily led by two turns , the picture dec@@ ep@@ ted .
Swedish Be@@ aches and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ o holds the world title - l@@ ent .
again , with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam , she re@@ aped up again with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ cked on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ afa was gone .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , named by the Americans &quot; grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after her bottom exercise she threw the audience into kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading t@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous attack of Phoenix have been killed while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots out of a hand fire@@ arm , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder was not the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y affair , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said that shooting was led by investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in His@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown draw@@ back from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to its injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which led to an empty pickup truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ gs and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , playing toys and of course his mother .
but like most of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund has a micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , over which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I can &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t create that .
wher@@ eu@@ pon I did not let myself alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her were told that under certain circumstances Ed@@ mund could never recognize her and that he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested institution@@ alization of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a help .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund chose for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented a few characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic , as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Si@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I always wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I have not asked for the forecast for a long time , because I did not expect anyone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call off the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded their shores and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding in extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that the state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood @-@ powered vehicles , boats and sand sacks were repeated .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone requested ten thousand Sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
a flood warning system was deployed in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record level over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that an up@@ stream @-@ downward flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these streams flow slowly over the assigned rivers into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still sw@@ elled people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water was streaming and streaming in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there had never seen such a rise of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members had all han@@ di@@ caps and he was the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency sur@@ fers had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer registered in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been considerably su@@ cked down by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rain and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching ou@@ tre@@ ach in five districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa bo@@ oted 200 buildings flooded .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
the Chief of the Municip@@ ality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond shel@@ ters were created to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; he said .
in Ham@@ mond town of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags were provided for residents to participate , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been reported to be in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday no reported .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holes perfor@@ ated by spheres , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police told us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents said Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm , and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through much , his small body was perfor@@ ated with balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it was apparently a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ gs for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ eded the crime scene .
it seems that this is definitely an ongoing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were leg@@ umes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year old girl was hit by a tor@@ tie at her arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e neighborhood .
she reco@@ vers and the police still searches for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I pre@@ tend to do under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , is the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female male gymn@@ asts was an African @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ rating routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so turn classes in the whole country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie fought all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison in order to get into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts first and foremost in private gy@@ ms , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these trainers lie in wealthy suburbs , which can support business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we must be inspired by countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , offering an affordable and accessible gymn@@ asi@@ um .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to young people who have the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health and for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of Girl Power through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gold and thank you for leaving so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistants who voted for a vote rejected him .
in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Country &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistants are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and week cal@@ endar@@ s in order to improve the care at irregular times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of B@@ MA committees for assistance physicians said last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current credit crisis and will meet all doctors &quot; requirements . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes caused by talks have met with the government on reluc@@ tance to participate , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was due to a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of assistants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of almost 13.@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to provide coverage to doctors on the pi@@ cket line .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to receive a better week pay for the 5@@ 4.000 assistants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor action measures do not achieve anything but little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and are just wor@@ rying , hard@@ ship and dis@@ ruption to patients , car@@ egi@@ vers and their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the committee of the resident doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from vocational training , training courses , reci@@ pro@@ cal recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the health ministry concerning adher@@ ence to agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation council recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation council recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot , which c@@ logged the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots break , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
N@@ ICE &apos;s draft bill , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered from a heart attack have yet another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ man Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of political rect@@ ness has led to widespread dis@@ integration in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off tapes outside of electoral cabinets to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends voters to demonstrate their identity in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present a vot@@ er has to call his name and address .
the report proposes that non @-@ removable ink will apply to a person &apos;s finger if they vote for their vote to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but should also protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ ection sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ man Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed himself particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leading of ID cards to prove identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence has been indicated that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... governmental institutions have ignor@@ antly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists handle letter selection documents in order to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists manage full postal elections and envel@@ opes of postal elections .
the police give the authority to set off lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change in law facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 &quot; Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 &quot; ( Volks@@ representation Act 1983 ) .
ban on photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees rule out the rule that voters go to the elec@@ tive cabin alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric stum@@ bles over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared l@@ ut@@ to Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was convic@@ ted for sufficient reasons - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city council &apos;s election registration departments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will run this week via the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by no means the only ath@@ lete to fight for gold that has his own famous double go@@ ose - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Sites that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood &apos;s celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star very similar , appeared .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the highlight of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big expressive eyes is said to be a doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one way higher : this user thinks that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor
another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ kindly , who shows similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va features more than just sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial expression and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in space : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial expression and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , broad smile , similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator on the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canadian sen@@ ator C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ in &quot; died &quot; and died during the race as a pig . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ est@@ yle Squ@@ ad .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought to the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
getting too excited went as he called , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming @-@ scale 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
people in the whole of Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot doesn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard , with which many talked about him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ sensi@@ tively By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the commentary on a floating performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times by the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the comment officer Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be em@@ itted .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ ons &apos;s comments referring to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to them as a person .
however , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swim in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to see when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a mark to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zed her as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf .
she continued to browse and propag@@ ated four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the mark business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman advoc@@ ated the under@@ pants before putting them back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants out of the delivery , pulled out her own h@@ um trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled off the under@@ pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she placed them on the shelf again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moved out and went out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to dis@@ rupt her being watching someone - or thinking about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she had ta@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how re@@ pul@@ sive to think that someone would take shelter with someone who had another person and who hadn &apos;t been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself against weapons attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
if you &apos;re approaching from behind you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the firing line , &quot; Miz@@ ra@@ chi says .
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
hit him with the knees in the gro@@ in and twist while the attack@@ er cur@@ bs against pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
in the case of attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line , grab the weapon and twist them so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and strike the attack@@ er on your chest , then twist the weapon from its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds tri@@ cky ?
watch the video to see exactly how Miz@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y it is most secure to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ bot for a travel guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller deprived of his immune system and the stran@@ gl@@ ehold of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k threw his course on a Euro note , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before checking each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea of replacing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily , nothing left behind did more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at railway stations to flush toilets , the job presented his immune system definitely under a rehear@@ sal
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial period showed a lumin@@ aire count of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet which he refused to refuse after their lumin@@ ance number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I &apos;m not going to check anything here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ date Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something fascinating to look at while at the same time explaining the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I ordered him to lick , like the faulty Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to check them out and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially related to the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social home after a delay with a damage of £ 50,000 because they had terrori@@ zed their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
when they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing associations &apos; employees found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were perfor@@ ated , wood boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was rub@@ bed to the walls .
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation by residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement got an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood plan@@ ks were pil@@ ed up
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing authorities and their partners forci@@ bly for@@ c@@ efully removed this week from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks in order to withdraw voluntarily .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said their life was made to Hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have re@@ aped the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years
tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter ad@@ mits to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family because del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall and members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and sent us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the floor .
workers in house management will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after being guilty of the possession of a class B drug in trade supervision .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who was killed in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police told Angela C@@ row that del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can act without self @-@ reproach and those who have been damaged by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete for the Spanish Super@@ cup in the du@@ el against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .

the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing in Barcelona for two years now as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision in this regard so far , and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen scored the first step in most of the other applications .
before the first match of the new season , Spanish master doubts about the fitness state of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test match between Liverpool and 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 at the rehear@@ sal against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince .

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
with this , the world ranking first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia .
bronze was awarded to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among each other .
thus it was clear that for the third time in a row , Chinese would fetch the single title in the mark of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sentences and time outs , they didn &apos;t have coaches .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their us@@ efulness in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had said .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma had to fight really only in the first sentence .
after that he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected ro@@ using match did not develop .
nevertheless , there was nevertheless plenty of breath taking place to see .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the bronze match against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ se had a ri@@ b injury in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) were inci@@ dentally in similarly high table tennis old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ ckers .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weakness of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently appearing mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aires vo@@ iced something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported .
after throwing 16 ri@@ vals inside the own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrong reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can bo@@ unc@@ y w@@ ob@@ bling
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor compl@@ ained of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions look forward , but not by the distance common for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he would stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or I will make a very beautiful , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no distinction than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s ok , Tr@@ ump added .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened the Tr@@ ump to cut funds to support its election campaign , so it should not be able to present better survey values .
instead of this , one wants to push the candidates of the Republi@@ cans more deeply into the hands of the Congress .
Olympics : three Sc@@ am Sc@@ am with Dop@@ ing Test
the IO@@ C aims to establish a disciplinary committee .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro event in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee communicated with immediate effect to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan official announced that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya &apos;s dop@@ ing control engineers .
IA@@ AF world association asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , and an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man included .
&quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was said in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , gave the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan boss de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become World Cup fourth in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at the Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time .
at the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it has been suggested that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing bill and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result WA@@ DA has taken Ken@@ yan from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
member Richard Po@@ und last asked for a similar examination in Kenya , as he had hired her in the Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was proved that in this sport it was cushi@@ oned nationwide and systematically .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members melanch@@ oly about her passion with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with it .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , back then the d@@ unge@@ ons went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them .
they are the same themes and they are as meaningful today as those days .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ sk@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was sev@@ ent@@ een years old and after her family died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; we can only hope that the only good thing is - as a warning and warning to others that this is the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London got into a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain as candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Scottish confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader of the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge on the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he would not have talked to Clinton for nom@@ in@@ ating Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ulating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the US App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said that Republi@@ cans blocking the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination are ministers and heroes of Republi@@ can presidential candidates Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .

but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distinguishes , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he thinks that it does the Calendar too .
&quot; we must return to the exposition of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ based Foundation Dialog and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Board of Management of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Stiftung Di@@ alogue and World .
the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh prepar@@ edness of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection @-@ seeking refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fights against minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already covered Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ alties for months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing Turkey in Turkey .
after the put@@ sch put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further repres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Association compl@@ ained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
thus , Erdo@@ gan was aiming to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association called for the Federal Government to &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mi@@ cians the professional existence .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and Sa@@ ws , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Foundation Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper under appeal on numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks presented the largest group of asylum @-@ seek@@ ers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on the balance sheet date June 30 this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all recognized as entitled to be entitled ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are no conflicts between war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individual persec@@ ut@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives receive nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania they understood .
in 2021 , the Parliament will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
more stupid than before : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during vac@@ ations , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , ballo@@ ons infl@@ ate , fl@@ yers and end voices , only lab@@ ori@@ ously apply .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to make an election campaign for just under the race .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , just started .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a coalition of the SPD / CD@@ U , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign of election , one can see from his large posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise seaf@@ aring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel has the blame on the blos@@ som@@ ing of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if you make a campaign at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice been invited to German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag election circle lies in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree that there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as well as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s also a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country you are crum@@ bling the base that it has to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly exists in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election warri@@ or Kok@@ ert on his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is on stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into an especially dedicated campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at election 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven per cent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ necessity and lay mainly their election campaign into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the pres@@ idents of Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go on search for traces of local vocal cords among vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just curves with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 renovation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work which starts at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and ends only at 8 : 00 pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet Fuel Station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the commen@@ cement of the work in charge of the construction works is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ dient expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now ride from the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen .
the travel through the place seems to be going back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the management of the rehabilitation project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ Von trail , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Sch@@ leich@@ wege were looking for and more likely to trust their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks missing in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality strengthened the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been heated .
the fastest was at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales collap@@ ses makes everyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , has hardly any consequences for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the balance is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words .
that is exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; hit hard . &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenues are quoted on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dump@@ ed its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his associates .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the reference that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to its long history .
he can understand that other regular passengers now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about the fact that his regular client@@ ele comes back after the renovation works .
in spite of the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its many years of history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
laws are constantly being ro@@ uted in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a lesson status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère forms the Vers@@ ati@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior on the presentation of his new safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in it .
but as Minister of the Interior , he was at the results and in a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has taken a short time before presenting his conclusions on safety in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced that a new security agency is supposed to take care of un@@ encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment , and to kno@@ ck the jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast @-@ procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities to incar@@ cer@@ ate people before deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
for asylum seek@@ ers rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some even worse than until now - about those who commit crimes or sub@@ consciously disc@@ ard their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
some also have an un@@ fur@@ i@@ ated effect and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that people deeply occupied themselves could not complain about in election campaigns .
the focus is on inner security .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
with the issue of internal security , the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking place .
in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties .
only a tent@@ ative argument about the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the managers also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a departure from the dual nationality .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also dealing here with conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he has nothing to stop from a double pass .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
to re @-@ open , don &apos;t make sense .
and he had constitutional obj@@ ections with a Bur@@ ka ban .
whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , has yet to show itself .
there is a lot in it , which could cause disputes .
but the SPD is also currently attempting to pro@@ spec@@ tus in the topic of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly signals the willingness to talk and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still able to gli@@ mmer through .
despite diesel sc@@ andal , deliveries are rising worldwide .
but it does not run in all markets .
in the recall action , there are vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with deliveries .
in spite of the many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest automobile manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July , VW became weaker , particularly in Western Europe , and thereby neg@@ atively imp@@ acted the total sales , as the company announced in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the Volkswagen brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann carried out the weaker figures out of July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there have been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ ec@@ ar escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus in beech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected domestic mark of Lower Saxony continues to be bo@@ unc@@ ing through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition loss of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is to be booked .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sale between January and July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer provides the customer with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for this is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW @-@ representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that there was a meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output after retro@@ fitting , no deterior@@ ations will take place and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide concept of &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen believes that , for example , half a year after the conversion , for example , customers can come into a workshop for half a year - and that could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in the case of customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ andal , leads to uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations , as it was said .
that is why VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pun@@ ish@@ ments from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not fear to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay a penalty of 0.4 per cent .
in September , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is asking for this fee from private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been protecting 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , he now continues to bear the costs .
letting cash lie in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the bank officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their bank account fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ bank and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Financial Officer of the Bank Association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , endow@@ ed with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she be@@ ware for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs res@@ ide in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no further banks are currently known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calculating a compensation rate for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federation of German Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition was tough , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like it in the width .
destination She@@ ets : who actually bu@@ ys gram@@ ophone records ?
lonely men middle aged loving panels .
before heading to the comment section to skip it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ e Men &apos;s Middle Ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ g@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers are reluc@@ tant to spend their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ g@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run a modest grey suit in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , before I stop , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of Data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of people : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records are pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot via e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , the walls of his living room dress .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , when I was 11 or 12 . things that I thought was a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can be found on the You@@ g@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and set themselves to buy their old records .
as a rule , people have dischar@@ ged their collection from the discussions that I have led .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to fans of the record changing of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some of the record fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar sound plate envel@@ opes , of objects that evo@@ ke happy memories .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s so with a lot of people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a worker fle@@ es from a board stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an IC@@ M survey revealed in April that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while browsing through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of people : three middle @-@ aged people ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone only recently came in and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the LP almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience as I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age children and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of New Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ des and sex@@ sor@@ rounded pop in place of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks strange , but the mental trauma is hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a window shopping as a wholesale purchase .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the impression to mu@@ stering the je@@ ans hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
although my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ bles , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums , do not take into account .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not by st@@ rolling through the record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records as they avoid the star@@ ing gaze of an aw@@ k@@ ward , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who raises nothing more susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French court dec@@ lines offering over demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state was authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , which would cost a fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also suggested that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely track@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that the food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in the community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp was increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite the dis@@ appointment of the Olympics : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic Time , cycli@@ st Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get down .
&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and fight on , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly find it difficult to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyze in peace which reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll look at everything we &apos;ve changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are being tested , which are supposed to over@@ ride Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der particularly effectively .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident places where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to be rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary gl@@ itter for compliance with speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days at un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
laser measuring technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the raised state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer by car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ amped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also bul@@ let @-@ proof outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities flash with the new technique : recently France ordered 100 copies , following an order of 150 units last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ franc Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji master class gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ star Ru@@ g@@ by in the final on Thursday evening came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ e Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als the same day could fall on it in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it probably won &apos;t - at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ry@@ an , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under Ry@@ an , they lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lose one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and allowed the attacks to boun@@ ce out of fun .
it felt like the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if they were running in driving coaches . the World Series Win@@ ner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze in the corner .
after four minutes of playing Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a delicious T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute Ath@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua went a touch down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the whi@@ stle and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u squee@@ zed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while still learning GB .
this is how it is .
GB led basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant Inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Se@@ an sul@@ fi@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ inging and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame finished the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced himself and GB no@@ d@@ ded crus@@ hing into the grass .
earlier on that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the coach of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ bl@@ ematic gold than with these games and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve , who enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was always present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympics in a row without tax @-@ woman , the first women in the history of British sports that set such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ t un@@ broken commitment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected in the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al march .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no one who was more helpful than the trainer who did not know before 30 months whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right concept at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts passed to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ aking morning with something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . this might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats just how much that means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best coach of the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , p@@ anning and glob@@ alization had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; St@@ ay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something new .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a time out for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I &apos;m an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for 31 years
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the big water producers .
it was that time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken stran@@ gled the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sailed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who has been a member of the Association for 31 years , 28 years of which as Managing Director .
now he retired from reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ den@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , transports approx . 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was employed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work to office and organisation activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new F@@ oun@@ tain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , refur@@ bish@@ ment of the elevated reser@@ vo@@ irs ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and new innovations have been added , because water is the most important food for life and drinking water .
in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ den@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful cra@@ mp .
together , we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ ner on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n was also possible only because one filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ ingen with hoses .
the management of the Dr@@ inking Water Pur@@ pose Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

type of Relation@@ ship in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man is shooting at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and injured them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called on us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator was fle@@ eing , and after him became public prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
meanwhile nationwide because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is approximately 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burnt and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , you should call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck didn &apos;t first wanted to make any information about the day or the relationship between the perpet@@ rators and the victims ; but she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .

financial burdens , which threatened the industry from green electricity promotion , are from the table .
it remains in the eman@@ cipation of the renew@@ ables uph@@ eav@@ al at the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental statement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall warmly welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity production .
as a result , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weigh@@ ed down in the reform of emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation was exac@@ erb@@ ated further by the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China cast tons of steel to the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unclear how sustainable the price pick @-@ up is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at last Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not intend to exclude the closing of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
despite rising prices and increasing orders , the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious in July .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced amount returned the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has increased by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the Association anticip@@ ates rising output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , mind , health : singing is doing well for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the teacher &apos;s study she occupied the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors chor@@ us .
&quot; singing motiv@@ ates me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , it feels balanced , cheerful and total livel@@ ier , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
regular gather@@ ings allow sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because social and family structures often arise in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
for doing this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs get rid of the pu@@ ff in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Sen@@ iors @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ations ( Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Sen@@ iors @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ations ) .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher significance , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia suffer@@ ers have long lain dor@@ man@@ t events .
in the case of singing , a special performance is also required to the head , explains L@@ enz .
focusing simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ esteem also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : when I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
there are plenty of good reasons to start singing .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors &quot; choir , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does well and has something fre@@ eing - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ bly as males on scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect has the reputation of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise , the m@@ owing also did not allow the males to cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätz@@ chen , who are in great distress , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) have found out .
han@@ go@@ vers ad@@ mitt@@ edly react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the caus@@ tic cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
altogether nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised additionally .
despite the small sample , the researchers maintain their results in a meaningful way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when the cri@@ es of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens were playing .
this faculty may be con@@ genital or develop@@ ped with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , no matter if they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , was not to be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , it is also not possible to stop football .
the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ pf@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of the minister Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared an end to Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
what den@@ ies the size of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the Cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is particularly time to arrive to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the tro@@ phy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
after the Pre @-@ Round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; f@@ arewell too early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve done it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher King laid the basis on the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the time of AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez signed and annex@@ ed to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the coup attempt failed to return because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about one third of his estimated annual salary , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for med@@ als in Rio .
dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines of the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who compl@@ ained about the games after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock , was pi@@ ped out and rested on her start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it offered a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a s@@ unken smile , she was still standing in the hall and provoked with her appearance .
when it was clear that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a che@@ er @-@ storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start with the Olympic Games in Rio in spite of dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the field of athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , and is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to wear a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after receiving the pain medication Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had severe tooth@@ ache after an operation and the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the forbidden stimulus @-@ agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the capture and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive for 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , em@@ ailed mer@@ ging .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fest , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete had been awarded so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having established testosterone dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic Silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championship for testosterone deficiency .
in 2008 , the Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ da@@ ille of the 2008 Olympic Games received a certificate from the International Criminal Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , it ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 year old world champion , evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement was found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on 13 July .
bom@@ bing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but have already been able to leave it again .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , said Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , one Thai people were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two Spr@@ ints went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured at the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the seaside resort Pat@@ ong , which was popular with holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally calls for det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast caused several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express himself to possible motives , but most likely it is the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
the authorities would have kept secret evidence of forthcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they were not informed of the exact time and locations .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the next bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need for necessary trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military a big influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to fom@@ ent chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , considers himself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several regional offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also observed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence points for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Executive Vice President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are treated in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - already observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ aß &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that his authority was closely aligned with the regional offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts generally try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a solic@@ it@@ ous advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to address people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
Ma@@ aß said he did not know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - will change its direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist and so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
looking at the significant increase in legal action and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ fia said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other rights @-@ terrorism groups or groups of small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rights @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects at attacks on asylum lod@@ g@@ ings had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , perhaps politically in@@ different or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which then radic@@ alised through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ then became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more famous in under@@ represented countries .
since most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ ed simply wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter free style , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to stand alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of free @-@ standing .

Tr@@ ump sees the im@@ pending election defeat not so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking at an election campaign in Florida .
should there be anything with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video .
he then travels to vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV transmitter CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump .
he thus called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
post increases in trading with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle from the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is evi@@ dently large .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the company soon wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
as of next year , the post office will also offer its electric v@@ ans on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they will ship their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other farms .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ der said there are always questions , for example by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group plans to enter into mass production of vehicles shortly .
in the post office factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ ald had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we move the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership dec@@ lines according to dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K Consumer Research Company exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the rear entran@@ ces suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K makes it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will become even more uncertain as the longer the success promised by him remains .
tur@@ mo@@ il at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the global number five in the industry faces a new beginning .
at the end of the year , the G@@ RP chief executive will leave the company .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Gf@@ K Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already been reti@@ ring from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
as of September 1 , the management of the Executive Board will take over the previous Executive Board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differing views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention details .
who will be leading the market research company in the future , is still unclear at this time .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholder was most recently dis@@ ap@@ pointing about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ head since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said .
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder is at some point rest@@ less .
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , they would do the same thing , &quot; he said .
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company was unable to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of comparable previous year &apos;s quarter .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent at EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
earnings in the second quarter above all imp@@ acted the company &apos;s dr@@ unken value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s impair@@ ment of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business segment , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K Group generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured people
in the event of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries and reported the police .
according to her specification , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach was forced to ev@@ ade an accommo@@ dating vice , partly on the opposite track .
the bus desc@@ ended to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency medical ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travelers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum from a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fee per cubic metre of waste water will amount from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3.4 . Euro 44 ( up to now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for the Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high @-@ rate calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the Office of Agriculture , Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that sub@@ contractors are running for these sewage treatment plants .
due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ effective manner .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Director of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed to the body , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the sewage treatment plants of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , covers and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period are to be compensated .
Schmidt explained the serious charges in charge of all three sewage installations by relatively small installations with a very small waste water case , which lay between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , in the past period of calculation , in all three plants , not least due to their age renovation and repair expenses have fallen in a considerable scope .
the facility in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage ponds had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system was installed in order to comply with the legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that with the small waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; full . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the process , Schmidt added , the market share of great entertainment costs in the waste water systems has been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious after the view of stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ bach@@ tal waste water association cannot be extended because it is defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .

the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10.5 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
snapshot says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , it allows a snapshot of around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein canvas .
the filters are imm@@ aculate , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million enh@@ ancements per day .
all of the mis @-@ appearances come to the public .
snapshot filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app &apos;s black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users proposed a filter which gave them s@@ lit eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage became widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended to pay tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ ism rec@@ alled the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others decided to reject anim@@ e comparison .
grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote in an e @-@ mail , whose twe@@ ets were widely spread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and in@@ convenient . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluc@@ tant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ safe , but that the yellow face was pulled into the extreme extreme .
snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural tri@@ g@@ gering .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterpart in terms of race - could expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that racial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the major part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said Chin@@ es@@ me @-@ ameri@@ can Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , on the other hand , said she &apos;ll shut down her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command had changed intelligence in order to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions of the congress were allowed to report in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the military committee , intelligence committees and the military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short , C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence @-@ related information , typically gen@@ dered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , drew a positive picture of the US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , a republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed persistent issues in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government officials under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were considerably more positive than facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com relatives publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is underway through the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
the democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force conclusions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shi@@ p , delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged Mor@@ ality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es about the White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts as regards a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor who received complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor is still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful campaign of air under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a letter about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , only fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq and soon van@@ ished to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US is winning fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is standing before
one day after firing three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not among the people who remember their gates .
however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same time in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan are un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed will take slightly longer the strong D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man out of the way leading the other group .
as always the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed at the last 12 seats at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things to a better place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely torn the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back @-@ hand gesture from the close range .
India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amidst the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is handed to tri@@ athletes from the wrist protecting to the gymn@@ ast .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the chat of your neighbor in the coffee shop , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the contro@@ versy between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there &apos;s Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics , and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among those familiar names that were sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
but if I could make some arguments for my particular favorite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely perceived that many of those I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school as the one for the Olympics .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which it essentially unites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , holding and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
they are rated according to the official Olympi@@ ad of execution , difficulty and flight time .
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
in their quest for gold medal @-@ lo@@ aders have to go further , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also another highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympic @-@ record .
the goal @-@ directed aspir@@ ation is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant aboli@@ tion of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympic man@@ ia they promise a calm , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US tur@@ ner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to come to the air .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that dozens of demonstr@@ ators were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at bul@@ lets .
is Ethiopia actually breaking together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror across the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if any , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , where dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ j@@ m Tes@@ home , an instructor in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on power of the ruling coalition .
after a far more critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years have been forced more or less forced to take advantage of turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness now explo@@ de after years of t@@ ink@@ ering at the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians acknowledged that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ rit@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally domin@@ ates by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special en@@ quiries to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for fairly obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia witnessed such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to analysts , apparently ple@@ aded by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama founded IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by fear@@ ing that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos; presidential candidates if he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings along his fellow campaig@@ ners , who endeav@@ our to take refuge in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant .
after having made the announcement at an electoral campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump rested in regards to the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he told the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism boun@@ ties down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later declared &quot; Of course , I mean sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction drops . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements enough enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of curing the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ bor@@ ated tone , as its poll@@ s have gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big head start in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is increasingly focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps has brought his loyal allies into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent speakers , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back @-@ bro@@ ker , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread herself by aggres@@ sively controlling the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s excuse as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once above the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a well @-@ stock@@ ed caf@@ eteria in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were displaced .
the soap store So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which expi@@ red in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it &apos;s also a rein@@ vention .
a revi@@ ved verb cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing associate of the old café , who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hing like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , Rebec@@ ca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , formerly lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had closed , she had a coffee drink for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that there was a coffee and a culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ w with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still deal with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new client has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pre@@ tends to put them out soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café was closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a foo@@ die , Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the US , while Ziegel@@ man tells in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; An ongoing meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ef@@ ree snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Turkey with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ ery , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abundant food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cream cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; traces the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne .
&quot; it was a time when the American food was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the new bud@@ dy was equally ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole re@@ used as a &quot; wonderful species , food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; noted Ziegel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
odd mixtures have been tried out , since a calorie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , brick @-@ man prepared a dish from that time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; Co@@ e says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household goods recipes .
as never before or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - ab@@ rup@@ tly rejected the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping politicians , &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
particularly tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ E@@ at @-@ E@@ ach .
while publicly pra@@ ising the simple I@@ owa Far@@ mer &apos;s cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke like a million @-@ million man from the world to whom he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , today &apos;s house@@ keeper had no interest in flavors by Mr@@ s Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , has been dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs again .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and nour@@ ishment , said bri@@ ck@@ man , and on how science was used on food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind flow incident .
after the plates had been cleared with Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt did eat lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a chic name with modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone sub@@ tly di@@ ved a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
stran@@ gely , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took a night strike three times .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few h@@ ack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life in the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group that according to Bild @-@ Zeitung had saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers lend their own lives to the game in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian prot@@ ector , which shows him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
but as a hero he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the recent bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters had dischar@@ ged four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the el@@ dest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland h@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland h@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.@@ 220 metres .
only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle @-@ inspired lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed that Greenland h@@ arks will become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they mainly live in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their slow @-@ motion @-@ pace measured them , when they paid six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they possibly hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and are looking for cad@@ a@@ vers , that swing from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland h@@ arks , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the biggest shar@@ k measured 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens occurs before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will not be re@@ done later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks have notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore likely to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear ar@@ ming attempts to disper@@ se large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 cm , the lens nucle@@ us on the other hand contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their lens nucle@@ us , all larger Greenland h@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k would probably be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign their length to an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland h@@ arks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time .
also this should be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a fl@@ aming torch .
they mature later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in a double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focuss@@ ed on topics relating to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the announcement from Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the plot , par@@ cel@@ ing and exhaus@@ tion issues were clari@@ fied and the applications were made to survey , the plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße , section 1 ) are no longer available to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , volunteers can now immediately report to the Town Hall , and the municipality is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to also request en@@ quiries relating to the establishment of further business enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided not to change the land use plan newly created in sub @-@ sections only in the spring of this year .
for example , the industrial area already shown there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
thus , the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting displaced jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary houses can continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , authorisation has been given to them in the UK so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently using large US banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which is responsible for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , and other important authorities such as the European insurance provider E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk basket ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , as well as Dublin &apos;s infrastructure deterior@@ ates .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
the city also features easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than on the River Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company &apos;s consulting Merc@@ er , the city stands at No. 7 , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the economic researchers mean .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry were working in London at the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent disputes with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. counterpart decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a claim for damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents that were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ ad@@ i of Gilead , after an American judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead was entitled to reli@@ ance on the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to treat Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained and claimed property on laboratory work , which included sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the US have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb through the city after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried within the city .
they exemp@@ ted over 2,000 civilians held as ho@@ stages by the comb@@ at@@ ants , Shar@@ able shared the wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters who were alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently conducting exploration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million to chari@@ ties , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton contributed USD 3 million income from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their term of office in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement .
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ ounc@@ ements and re@@ patri@@ ates in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his attor@@ neys have stated tax inspection by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tic , among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business models and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday , promp@@ ting high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she also talked about the topic during a speech to the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the past decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , the information that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; fears &quot; from the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons currently living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 2015 tax declaration showed that these are just USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its principal financial investment was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ Fund , from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ill@@ i powder , fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ill@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ tour Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , together with U.S. nature protection intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ maker Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ic@@ li@@ pu@@ y mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom te@@ ats up with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust of ch@@ ill@@ i powder into the air .
a hint is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last option is a shi@@ py@@ ard that shoots a golden fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
town council unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ osk system on the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhine bank
in general , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of industrial companies with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and tackle - however , retail in the core city is considered to be significantly expanding .
however , the City Council unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a commercial district on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balaton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk doesn &apos;t fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath to the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; prompt - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pres@@ election since it would have requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center .
searching for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ mann called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident spark@@ ed quite a lot of resonance on the internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; shame you , &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ dam@@ m , is near a synagogue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police force tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police took tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police rub@@ bing rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the participants of the protest saw Gra@@ ffi@@ cking against the preliminary president Michel Tem@@ er spra@@ yed on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate on their vocation .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the sales turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies has increased greatly to businesses in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in comparison to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan runs from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation gave some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market covered in forest seed oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid was carried out on Thursday evening at the Re@@ we XXL drinking market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the restra@@ int of a fire@@ arm , three dark clothed persons who had m@@ um@@ med their faces were asked by the employee of the beverage market to issue cash and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
how much money has been captured doesn &apos;t share the police .
the perpet@@ rators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and badly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpet@@ rators must be run after the attack in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel parking place located opposite the car park entrance to the car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of action ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer break
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical daily group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet surroundings of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of the school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it was possible to b@@ ail out with the visit of the string zoo .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash .
culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their own homemade pa@@ stries such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and the b@@ olog@@ n@@ ese b@@ olog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops were created , beautiful jewelry designs made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of departure the sun and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , were on their way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were met together .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ el@@ pilgrimage of all the altar boys in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ ten@@ win St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were examined and finally decided for the Bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 And min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the Holy Ghost , rose up in the way .
in the evening before , Pri@@ est Stor@@ ost had sent the pilgrims a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s crosses and par@@ ted the pilgri@@ m &apos;s sa@@ ils .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the single day tours were framed by a short impulse , each morning and evening , with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeat@@ ed@@ ely started to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgri@@ m song .
for the overnight stays there were par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes available .
at the stage @-@ points Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty as well as tonic dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at the first time around 500 meters of altitude had to be desc@@ ended and afterwards climbed again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg .
Min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy at the later afternoon at the Freiburg Min@@ ster and crossed the gates of mercy .
here God was thank@@ ed with a little impulse .
the Min@@ is by co operator Markus Ober@@ t arrived at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to see the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ dale Met@@ ropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last evening in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . he made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home in order to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after being held in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos;s withdrawal only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualification round , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn , Hin@@ der was slightly back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation moving in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they stepped on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
in the final round , we set up an Olympic cord and defeated the world champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 Triumph at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ di said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole of the GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to get back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle rom .
with the shape Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly sacred date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the quick@@ est performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record gained gold in London 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he was argu@@ ing yesterday with delegates before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow and ended , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archives of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a flock of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama was in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amidst sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ings and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle @-@ rom it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land on the basis of ann@@ ul@@ ment of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the system .
a subsi@@ dy , set for 20 years , exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 jobs at the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa Castle closed the Point Henry melting shop , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
Al@@ coa &apos;s melting shop in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies large aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Corp. hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L further said that the contracts were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects the contracts in the fiscal year to contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecast of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expecting a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; Al@@ co@@ as ability ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt &quot; does not affect .
the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn against the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said Port@@ land uses around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a car@@ dam@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ ance of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , scre@@ ened reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a broadcasting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ dam@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine &apos;s September issue is a league for itself .
the September edition is for Vo@@ gue the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an image volume rather than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista have been advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zers ) .
the revelation of his cover star is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still se@@ ep before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , yod@@ elling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she finds herself in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous individuals or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mist@@ ers of the Moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these feelings were high again when the message came out with the appearing J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying around on the mis@@ fu@@ ge seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
she is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centers assign 16@@ 0,000 people a year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid cases are rejected every year by the municipal government centres , while the industry impacts on the effects of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal advice .
legal services in the municipality that are already over@@ loaded are ready for further reductions .
from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the convention centre of Que@@ isi@@ a James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Tow@@ ns Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are already rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ al the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal law centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been divor@@ ced , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Camp@@ a@@ ign indic@@ ted after Staff allegedly drew gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina put a gun on one employee in February , while she was on a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i admitted having been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compl@@ ained at the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i stated that already at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the bill of indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation was only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owner and ar@@ senal - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judges should appoint .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ is complaint demands damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and permanent emotional damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip was also out of place .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
it was not re@@ acted to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) are notable for the SPD and CD@@ U &apos;s governing party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could barely rule , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD is the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent over five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just short of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previous 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country parliament .
despite slight losses , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 per cent ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the country parliament by 3 percent respectively .
according to the survey , the SPD voted only 23 per cent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they therefore still lag@@ ged behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would be missing in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was rather pal@@ p@@ able .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the shops 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they come somehow out of the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; West pocket format office . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be a lot for those standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit very slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euro .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone saved an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , suppliers dominate the market , all of whom came later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use via touch screen .
the triumph of Apple began , the iPhone is still the most important product of the group today .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must turn the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local authorities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this represented the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row as well as in 2012 in London when we spent a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and local companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs , and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s enlargement is too big .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bla@@ zing on the world stage .
the doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in swe@@ at@@ y growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding advertising blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding about its advertising , to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a B@@ log@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth conflict between the pending open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become a concern for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ wers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the assets &quot; advertising revenue .
apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokes@@ man shared it .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenue , so Facebook is worth investing in such a step as rewar@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ ential Pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertisement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a d@@ ull means , which is why we have concentrated on Develop@@ ers tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead to put more control into the hands of people .
women suspected of comm@@ itting suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police are calling for witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway during the early morning hours on Thursday during a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fell on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss lady wanted to kill himself at the age of 49 , which was over@@ taken by several vehicles , including a truck .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , sum@@ mon@@ ed them to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter announced to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the public prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases , where a person ran in the dark on the motorway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after passing a man and killed a man lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the road .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had responded to an emergency call -- to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once was hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms resem@@ bling climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have brought up similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly progres@@ sed .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus displays its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , similar to evolution , which was previously assumed by planet scientists .
although it was supposedly hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions of years .
her oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gene with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- Venus which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to little co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
as an alternative president / general manager of the Color@@ ados , Joe Sak@@ ic , this decision confirmed and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Patrick informed me of this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the club to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches showed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North @-@ ee@@ pers resume meetings again , strike a strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &apos; struggles on remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties involved sit down for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the UN@@ s and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of we@@ aving the present dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start early next year to restart the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut its rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional reductions will give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ swing .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was strengthened by the British ruling in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to be spending on new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star cluster as well as in what context the rot@@ ational time periods are with the creation of planets .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they turn the fastest now .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars meet large amounts of star winds .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the occurrence of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars revol@@ ving slower than smaller ones .
&quot; at the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is much more to tell us about how , how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
following his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
he will act as a consultant and youth coach until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
but nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted into the bas@@ eball hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star appeared at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to have taken away ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal up to the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for many years .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time , sweet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once more received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy @-@ creations of the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Go@@ z@@ hin@@ sky are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : for a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Go@@ z@@ hin@@ sky from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
an experienced ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events in Rio de Janeiro have become known .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Go@@ z@@ hin@@ sky have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately prior to the beginning of the already cri@@ tically poll@@ inated athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to the un@@ time .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a protective agent for dop@@ ing substances , has already been proven in Ch@@ en last Sunday .
on Friday afternoon , the International Criminal Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have participated in the course of more than 50 m Fre@@ est@@ yle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ sample and hearing was requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation during the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the IC@@ S@@ CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news se@@ ep through the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive himself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act on the forbidden substance for the blood dop@@ ing EP@@ O .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should also have been positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly announced his criticism to the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing poll@@ uted nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Go@@ z@@ hin@@ sky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both of them contest the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous crimes in China had also taken care of violent confron@@ tations between athletes .
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion , Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sh@@ ly .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ est@@ yle , I want to pass over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested positively in the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to leave a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : thus h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail her ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Ab@@ wehr specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som money required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the si@@ ght@@ ings of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to send out ran@@ som will be significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes manager Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was very quick over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users are the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher when a Ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of German companies reported losses of turnover through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break off business activity , in one case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims per chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must take part hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Anti @-@ Virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is more prob@@ able , however , that it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
the existing malware kits have been created by purchasing malware , advice , and additional tools for a one @-@ time fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says .
the black@@ ma@@ ids then seek further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the boards on the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better safeguard their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey have confidence in rep@@ airing Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful completion , the perpet@@ rators will instead thre@@ aten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , much higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will tackle everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top does not fall off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l is available for folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a child seat and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling .
the boot space can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is still another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tested top variant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the safety systems is the City emergency braking system ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assist system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent temperature control respon@@ ds to traffic signs detection and lowers the speed when necessary .
the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket lie beneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will get from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is conceivable only in case of haz@@ ards that are typical of air transport .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the judgment .
the airline did not have to pay any damages to the man .
event of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
after their trip , sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back if the cause of the illness is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have been proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family suffered from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their holiday .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant , which supposedly so@@ iled the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was so poor - and compl@@ ained against the organizers .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizers only learned about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was al@@ right .
in other words , he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorists .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminal off@@ ences should leave the country more quickly , however , this increases the security and also strengthens the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals right up to the German Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be back under penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance needs to be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire will be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be ham@@ pered .
the most recently discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors should be maintained after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères &apos;s words .
however , he wants to search for solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession as to how the danger of citizens can be reduced , he said , with a look at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against Action@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of dual nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ veil conce@@ al@@ ment un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d anything you reject and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules such as traffic or witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter designed the minister he wanted to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist act of action and ability to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the highway feeder
it is st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this shall change : the rule of law shall be renewed .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jams when driving via the motorway / train ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) , the Landes@@ betrieb Straße der prolon@@ gs the legal bending track by 700 meters on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) .
drivers can then cycle directly from the hammer to the right .
the big advantage : traffic divi@@ des itself early , which improves the overall production process on the busy section of the road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the train station on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back@@ log to the bridge over the Alber@@ t@@ ago path and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here traffic is only ste@@ ered via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt thirty @-@ three years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity to track heavy @-@ duty traffic in particular .
the competent state company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the resulting work@@ day traffic will last .
but with years to come : because the bridge has an official remaining usage period up to 20@@ 34 .
the Landes@@ betrieb deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays for the extension of the legal de@@ ple@@ tion because of disability .
traffic is run on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Offers for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Forest School visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Kinder@@ haus Wald@@ schule has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning unit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between eleven and fifteen years attended the production in the Little House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster through this project .
between September 2015 and March 2016 , most of the young people in the class came from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , so the press release of the Junge Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg of Spra@@ ys , and the Young Theater will work together during the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without refugee and migration background between 14 and 20 years should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for better weather
the weather was made by the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ den , who with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep far before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes can be attributed to them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ alth , member of the Executive Board of the German Society for sleep and sleep medicine .
what one understands by the time being , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in- and through sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
as far as sleeping , many people feel inadequate or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the Executive Board at the German Medical Association with Practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially frequent in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Levin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors inter@@ rupt each other .
for example , anyone who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc might be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to smile about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
who does not sleep well over a period of at least three nights a week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor , advises We@@ alth .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : you are beaten , tired , innocent , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in question .
lowered sleeping medicine is hardly available in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why you should first contact your family doctor in case of sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in the sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise doctors , for example , with snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in case of sick sleep@@ iness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , you wear a nose glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on your finger .
in addition , a camera shows the sleeping end on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of locking screws where you can sleep for a better sleep .
fire counts : regular sleep and up@@ time , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you begin to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not good at all .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first took gold at the world champion@@ ships in Doh@@ a for the first time and at the same time presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues standing in the criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0,000 € , no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ster had to report already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the El@@ ection @-@ Hamburger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : airport pick @-@ up
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday the detention of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 was arrested by the police in Düsseldorf .
the suspi@@ ci@@ ons had committed several pocket and luggage @-@ pil@@ es as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30@@ h civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf airport repeatedly recognised a gang that was known to police officers from past anti @-@ theft crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July of this year and were involved in a collaborative , social and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department 34 can provide evidence of four acts that have been sent specifically for off@@ ences to Germany .
in doing so , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still a remainder of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain street does not seem like that at first sight , but the police numbers it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one goes along the road from east to west , one comes past play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator Henkel has been campaig@@ ning several times for a hard police action against the project , called the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers had been cleared , the police pat@@ ro@@ gated official statements three weeks later with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground , locked up parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
during the renovation of the building , the premises were commissioned by the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved away under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street appears peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about Vor@@ m Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who holds three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police force between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &apos; district , which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße very close to the Riga D@@ ome .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under great police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from all over the world : residents from the GDR times and former house occup@@ ants are now sharing their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga Gallery are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them in dis@@ car@@ ded discs or freshly painted facades , which were ir@@ oned with color p@@ ou@@ ches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned so often this year with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ liberal violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like physical injury are reported almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences are damages that tend to hit the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not sure .
even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer moved to Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
this is why it was so important to her that the residents got back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street is still taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that are displac@@ ing the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - there are rather people who are not so well poll@@ uted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can one do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of those who are fond of colour bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z neighborhood .
those who draw near should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub quarter , can complain badly about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ ge@@ e Repres@@ entative
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the Administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the experiencing wo@@ ollen mil@@ k@@ lust , which above all has a problem .
some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing rather than targeted on the multitude of desired areas of activity - meant that the administration wanted to write down the place .
sought was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long experience in the field of social work , just an un@@ finished wool milk sow .
but administrative work is not their central area , writes Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent stake in three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ our@@ ing- and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you must place the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the Municip@@ alities themselves .
the responsibility switches from the district council office to municipality and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work until now , if one relies on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so new containers will soon be set up in Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be p@@ ung@@ ed or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity does not only mean labour .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also administration and community of volunteers jump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach should not work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are problem cases , customer hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with nothing at all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small congregation such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the assistants are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were bringing them out completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and community officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region .
they are always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; we have not yet arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
