<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the riding career ended already again.</seg>
<seg id="10">Saturday was Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He moved with his family to the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even boar for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economies Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are at odds with tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies on a principled, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and warn about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be completely different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he is going to massively retract regulations, and he stands strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "on the other hand, Clinton said:" "" "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that one must be invested, says Trump and Clinton almost verbally.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, party-internal discussions might come up.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, Clinton is planning to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and demand: "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign either.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both parties do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rattle, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit will only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other side, Clinton standing at least by the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby who is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the business manager of Condrobs, a sponsor of social relief services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-minded women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs brought up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not even as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her flight," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Women outweigh other reasons for the escape: "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor murder, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the flight, this continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for instance, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whoever believes that as soon as they accuse Germany, the end tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and worst abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">She estimates that about 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they do not dare to talk openly about what they have experienced, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodations only for them, requires Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question, if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the accommodation of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone winged women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are some common shelters or houses for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "also the" "" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "" "committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "in a study published for the committee, it says:" "" "it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">As much as the women feel this need of protection, one can read the urge to go to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "since it has been around for us, we have a long waiting list," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the resident doctors called on their union to approve new work campaigns in their dispute with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "the JDC stated that ministers would have met ministers to respond to the concerns about the contract." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny myself that Ankara is the most willing to make this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was smallied and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as though there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's emanating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launching of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was aroused.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the right to rebuild will be difficult if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious allegations were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan would have benefited his own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting only took place because Putin received an excuse from President Erdogan to hear him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire lie clearly in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was removed nearly his office after a failed coup d "état last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, national television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Večsti put it like this:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West since it responds to its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continuing grudge is coming across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state in Ankara won with security a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" in Russia and Turkey: two countries that violate the West and feel bad and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference that they wouldn't even have matured the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey threw off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State would at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, who reaches the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He succeeds Sir Gordon Judge, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>

<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori picks up the jubilation when he brings victory on Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys hit the milestone in obstacle races - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 wins in a recruiting career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbywinner had 4,493 careers</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect, which distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have inspired fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said Frankie some weeks ago at Epsom, that he had already brought 6,000 profits if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already had nearly 30 years of winners in the UK, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flatrace for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerve wrecking.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month ban, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and to return to his best form.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin urges Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's tightest confidence in many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin it is said that without stating reasons" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs has ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who since 2012 was Ivanovo's deputy, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonian capital, he graduated at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it means (in Russian) that he later was the head of the protocol and Head of Staff of the Government Staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state with respect to bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest friends of Vladimir Putin for a long time and works for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But in spite of the ridicule for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once promoted as a potential president, at one time wants to direct Russian environmental policy - has met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated job - you could almost say - to entrust it for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term Putin's term would violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by Putin's other closest ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "lid blowers" "", "which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 different bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today, Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79% of the total deck is in place and the final section of Decks gets a concrete dash for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-proof high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the extension of the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards with an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party: investors should be put into duty a lot more strongly in future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "room for action" "" "at the next meeting session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D Group President Christoph Vimann says:" "" "we are in agreement with the Greens: anyone wanting to build on urban surfaces must pay 20 percent of all homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also arise in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big issue in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann said: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as 20 percent of the housing as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing construction programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, as Bratmann said:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few precepts as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left intends to make even tougher support for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as Bratmann said, the situation on the housing market is escalating.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the plan of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete, as the roughly 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do we compensate for the loss of other around 1300 low-priced apartments, whose promotion will continue in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning olitical spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now buy running bindings from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 dwellings could be brought back to the price range for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, the aim of the so-called thoroughfare is to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social-weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At first, the time on the screen was limited to television, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later came a cartoon series, playing cards, and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many other pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons tracking with a GPS and as soon as they have been found," "" "photographed" "" "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" "" "captured" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when it was younger, joined the turkey and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person restores each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardigrams, an app for Apple Watch who followed 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after market launch, the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" "" "get away" "" "30 minutes" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look elend." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you exercise regularly, you can reduce your chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also gruesome game-destroyers who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had previously been able to track our activity, they gave us no reason to exercise sport as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all the way.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast encircled on Thursday for the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team ameroun Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles are sculpting at the Winter Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a title and overall the fifth, while she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success is the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the 1984 Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">They expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between their and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single-part competition of women during the Winter Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the party coordinator of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned to have the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is geared to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, was trained in Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was easily led by two turns, the picture decepted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish Beaches and Bodenturns - in which Bilo holds the world title - lent.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, with 15,433 on the balance beam, she reaped up again with a 15.933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears flocked on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake to Mustafa was gone.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team captain, named by the Americans "grandma," had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her bottom exercise she threw the audience into kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series murderous attack of Phoenix have been killed while listening to the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots out of a hand firearm, while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police informed that the threefold murder was not the result of a robbery affair, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who owned one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that shooting was led by investigators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks in Hispanic residential areas within four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," told Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown drawback from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to its injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which led to an empty pickup truck half an hour before the threefold murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I pretend to do under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, is the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female male gymnasts was an African-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyrating routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so turn classes in the whole country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie fought all the same way as Aly and Madison in order to get into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts first and foremost in private gyms, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers lie in wealthy suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired by countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, offering an affordable and accessible gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who have the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health and for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of Girl Power through the Holes of the Olympic team gold and thank you for leaving so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors want to organise other strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistants who voted for a vote rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "No Man's Country" and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and week calendars in order to improve the care at irregular times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of BMA committees for assistance physicians said last night in a communication with: "assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat the current credit crisis and will meet all doctors" requirements. "</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes caused by talks have met with the government on reluctance to participate, and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was due to a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift up the condition and address the concerns of assistants." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA would like to receive a better week pay for the 54.000 assistants who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called on the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Mortimer said:" "" "labor action measures do not achieve anything but little, but already burden overloaded teams and service providers and are just worrying, hardship and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months we have spoken to the committee of the resident doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from vocational training, training courses, reciprocal recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the health ministry concerning adherence to agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name of Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">NICE's draft bill, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered from a heart attack have yet another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Due to a preliminary recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutman Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political rectness has led to widespread disintegration in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral abuse because of" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="6">He recommends voters to demonstrate their identity in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present a voter has to call his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes that non-removable ink will apply to a person's finger if they vote for their vote to prevent someone selects twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was ordered from Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutman Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>

<seg id="18">He expressed himself particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leading of ID cards to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report it says:" "" "evidence has been indicated that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the Elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Union in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you're approaching from behind you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the firing line, "Mizrachi says.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hit him with the knees in the groin and twist while the attacker curbs against pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist them so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and strike the attacker on your chest, then twist the weapon from its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds tricky?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller deprived of his immune system and the stranglehold of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk threw his course on a Euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking each object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of replacing the rinsing button of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left behind did more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at railway stations to flush toilets, the job presented his immune system definitely under a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial period showed a luminaire count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet which he refused to refuse after their luminance number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to check anything here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validate Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at while at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I ordered him to lick, like the faulty Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to check them out and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria especially related to the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the church building</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the renter admits to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family because delogization is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and members of the community who have courageously approached us and sent us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC aims to establish a disciplinary committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenyan athletes are threatened after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro event in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a trainer home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee communicated with immediate effect to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by the team leadership of Kenya's doping control engineers.</seg>
<seg id="8">IAAF world association asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert their own investigations, and an IAAF spokesman included.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the examination and the following actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it was said in an IAAF explanation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the rehearsal and signed," explained Kenyan boss de mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth in 2015 over 800 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed sportsmen of his country about upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the IOC after numerous doping contracts, Kenya has been under special observation for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the announcement of more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC before the Rio Games, it has been suggested that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted much pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping bill and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result WADA has taken Kenyan from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports of the ARD, accusations were repeatedly raised that doping means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports betting.</seg>
<seg id="24">Member Richard Pound last asked for a similar examination in Kenya, as he had hired her in the Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it was proved that in this sport it was cushioned nationwide and systematically.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they did everything pretty shaky," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet Fuel Station." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">The commencement of the work in charge of the construction works is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of expedient expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the businesspeople at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales collapses makes everyone who is asked to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants were "hit hard."</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the reference that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to its long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular passengers now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts about the fact that his regular clientele comes back after the renovation works.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.</seg>

<seg id="24">Some also have an unfuriated effect and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example, the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to say that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees.</seg>

<seg id="3">But it does not run in all markets.</seg>

<seg id="6">In spite of the many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's biggest automobile manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July, VW became weaker, particularly in Western Europe, and thereby negatively impacted the total sales, as the company announced in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the Volkswagen brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Germany's home market, deliveries declined by almost one sixth.</seg>

<seg id="15">Large support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the mainly affected domestic mark of Lower Saxony continues to be bouncing through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months only an extradition loss of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be booked.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sale between January and July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to retrofit into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the conversion, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After conversion of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "after the conversion, the car manufacturer provides the customer with a" "" "guaranteed" "" "certificate, but does not speak of a" "" "guarantee" "", "as it was said on Friday in corporate circles." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Focus" "" "had reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models." ""</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "Volkswagen does not use the term" "" "guarantee" "" "but not as it was called in corporate circles." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide concept of "warranty," Volkswagen believes that, for example, half a year after the conversion, for example, customers can come into a workshop for half a year - and that could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the case of customer interest, it is important to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the Abgasskandal, leads to uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations, as it was said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Sheets: who actually buys gramophone records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged loving panels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before heading to the comment section to skip it under the pseudonym non-Allegre Men's Middle Ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougv, the much discussed re-emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are reluctant to spend their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of Yougv?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run a modest grey suit in the middle of a busy street in Soho, before I stop, hold my hands and say something better than: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (Number of Data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of people: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records are pictured above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I didn't follow him home), the walls of his living room dress.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, when I was 11 or 12. things that I thought was a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can be found on the Yougv profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and set themselves to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a rule, people have discharged their collection from the discussions that I have led.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to fans of the record changing of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar sound plate envelopes, of objects that evoke happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's so with a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a worker flees from a board stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey revealed in April that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while browsing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of people: three middle-aged people) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only recently came in and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead soundboard so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the LP almost a whole floor, has a blower audience as I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage children and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of New Synthesides and sexsorrounded pop in place of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but the mental trauma is hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window shopping as a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the impression to mustering the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my research revealed that the results of YouGov agree, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectibles, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums, do not take into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not by strolling through the record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through records as they avoid the staring gaze of an awkward, 30-year-old false presenter who raises nothing more suspecting middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state was authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, which would cost a fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also suggested that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais are" "" "absolutely trackable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that the food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in the community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" "" "closing" "" "would be a disaster for these children of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp was increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters: in different federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested, which are supposed to override Temposünder particularly effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident places where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to be rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary glitter for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days at uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measuring technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans by time, stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the raised state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer by car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply clamped, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armoured and by the way also bullet-proof outer cover disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter against vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even foreign authorities flash with the new technique: recently France ordered 100 copies, following an order of 150 units last year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Britain fetches silver in the 7-franc Rugby after Fiji master class gold</seg>
<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-star Rugby in the final on Thursday evening came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the Dee Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals the same day could fall on it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and allowed the attacks to bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if they were running in driving coaches. the World Series Winner went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau froze in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">After four minutes of playing Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A delicious Tackle from Mitchell halted the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athasa Veremalua went a touch down in the right corner and stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the whistle and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou squeezed by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while still learning GB.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant Interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Sean sulfians, whose fans sang, flags swinging and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame finished the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fiff rang, the Fijis embraced himself and GB nodded crushing into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on that day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the coach of the trainer for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emblematic gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve, who enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was always present when they rowed to the second Olympics in a row without tax-woman, the first women in the history of British sports that set such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39.t unbroken commitment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not reflected in the nature of the triumphal march.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and there was no one who was more helpful than the trainer who did not know before 30 months whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right concept at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory her first thoughts passed to Williams, who spent a nerve wreaking morning with something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. this might be a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats just how much that means, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he's the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, panning and globalization had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make something new.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the" "" "Veitenstein Group" "" "sailed" "" "Bavarian far as exemplary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who has been a member of the Association for 31 years, 28 years of which as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he retired from retiring at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water association of the Veidenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, transports approx. 150000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are Kirchner, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was employed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work to office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new Fountain (1998) and compensation for farmers, refurbishment of the elevated reservoirs (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and new innovations have been added, because water is the most important food for life and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatio, she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has really lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veidenstein Group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful cramp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together, we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the Brunnenbau and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the rupture at the elevated tank at Kirchner on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of Neubrunn was also possible only because one filled the high tank of Pettingen with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the Drinking Water Purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Light view for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens, which threatened the industry from green electricity promotion, are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the emancipation of the renewables upheaval at the existing systems for the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a fundamental statement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall warmly welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity production.</seg>

<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price pick-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing is doing well for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the teacher's study she occupied the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors chorus.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing motivates me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, it feels balanced, cheerful and total livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular gatherings allow seniors to socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often arise in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get rid of the puff in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Seniors-Organizations (Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Seniors-Organizations).</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher significance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia sufferers have long lain dormant events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of singing, a special performance is also required to the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: when I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors "choir, one can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does well and has something freeing - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high-rate calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the Office of Agriculture, Kulmbach found that subcontractors are running for these sewage treatment plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Director of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed to the body, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage treatment plants of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, covers and undercover from the previous calculation period are to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious charges in charge of all three sewage installations by relatively small installations with a very small waste water case, which lay between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past period of calculation, in all three plants, not least due to their age renovation and repair expenses have fallen in a considerable scope.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welshahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage ponds had to be removed, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation system was installed in order to comply with the legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapshot says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it allows a snapshot of around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein canvas.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million enhancements per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of the mis-appearances come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapshot filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app's black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users proposed a filter which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended to pay tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism recalled the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decided to reject anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote in an e-mail, whose tweets were widely spread over the photos that the filter was "hurtful and inconvenient."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluctant Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-safe, but that the yellow face was pulled into the extreme extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural triggering.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterpart in terms of race - could expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "if one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting for a user," "" "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was earlier," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the major part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so that they can make such decisions," said Chinesme-american Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, on the other hand, said she'll shut down her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were considerably more positive than facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom relatives publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is underway through the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015 CentCom has created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest ranking Demokrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Ship, delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaged Morality among analysts and" "" "gave too little space for deviating opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues about the White House intervention in the CentCom analysts as regards a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector who received complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful campaign of air under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a letter about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq and soon vanished to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these temporary refineries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is handed to triathletes from the wrist protecting to the gymnast.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the chat of your neighbor in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the controversy between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics, and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among those familiar names that were sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I could make some arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely perceived that many of those I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school as the one for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, holding and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated according to the official Olympiad of execution, difficulty and flight time.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">In their quest for gold medal-loaders have to go further, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also another highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympic-record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-directed aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatiguing when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic mania they promise a calm, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objectification of male athletes - as the male US turner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to come to the air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of demonstrators were killed during the clashes with the police at bullets.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia actually breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror across the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if any, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, where dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Sejm Teshome, an instructor in Central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far more critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years have been forced more or less forced to take advantage of turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of tinkering at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians acknowledged that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemritu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia illegally dominates by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special enquiries to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for fairly obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia witnessed such a turmoil in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which, according to analysts, apparently pleaded by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amperan city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin balancing act." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded IS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by fearing that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "Founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans' presidential candidates if he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings along his fellow campaigners, who endeavour to take refuge in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an electoral campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump rested in regards to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he told the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism bounties down on Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared "Of course, I mean sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and if necessary" clarify "depending on how the reaction drops." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements enough enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of curing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corroborated tone, as its polls have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a big head start in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps has brought his loyal allies into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocally his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent speakers, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CNN interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it back-broker, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread herself by aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Once above the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint returns</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a well-stocked cafeteria in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from Bedford Avenue shop front were displaced.</seg>
<seg id="4">The soap store Soap Cherie, which expired in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people smoked it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it's also a reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing associate of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishing like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer more, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently, Rebecca Oliveira has been such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after having moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "after the verb" "" "Verb" "" "had closed, she had a coffee drink for a while, she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it became clear to me that there was a coffee and a culture in the verb that I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing customer since the beginning of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came quarters after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no grudge about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered a special soap for brew with the cold brewed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "I think we will still deal with it," "" "Rodriguez said." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new client has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he pretends to put them out soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee into the bottles.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a foodie, Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacy of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "" "said Jane Ziegelman." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "An ongoing meal," which will be published on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, carefree snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" traces the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of Cockaigne.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when the American food was a central, tense theme," Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new buddy was equally tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole reused as a "wonderful species, food leftovers," noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Odd mixtures have been tried out, since a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>

<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at lunch," Coe says.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "brickman continues:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household goods recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - abruptly rejected the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeeping politicians," and the challenge to transform Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Particularly tasty are the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-Cake-Eat-Each.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praising the simple Iowa Farmer's cuisine of his kitchen, he spoke like a million-million man from the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," "" "Coe said." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor would have asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, today's housekeeper had no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, has been discarded as soon as the country returned to the legs again.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and nourishment, said brickman, and on how science was used on food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple had better understood the eating habits of brickman's mother-in-law in writing the book - for example, how they could not throw away food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the eldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland harks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland harks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle-inspired lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist assumed that Greenland harks will become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, after all, they mainly live in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion-pace measured them, when they paid six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They possibly hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and are looking for cadavers, that swing from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland harks, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest shark measured 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens occurs before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be redone later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks have notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore likely to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear arming attempts to disperse large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 cm, the lens nucleus on the other hand contained a small surplus of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens nucleus, all larger Greenland harks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark would probably be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign their length to an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland harks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose speck at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flaming torch.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the sales turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest in Russian companies has increased greatly to businesses in the country, the ambassador said.</seg>

<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports increased by 91.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $697 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch, St. Anna, were on their way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were met together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Romelpilgrimage of all the altar boys in two years, the Oberministrantenwin St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages were examined and finally decided for the Bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 And minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the Holy Ghost, rose up in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Priest Storost had sent the pilgrims a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's crosses and parted the pilgrim's sails.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The single day tours were framed by a short impulse, each morning and evening, with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedely started to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays there were parishes of the local parishes available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage-points Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as tonic dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at the first time around 500 meters of altitude had to be descended and afterwards climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Minis was visibly relieved and happy at the later afternoon at the Freiburg Minster and crossed the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Here God was thanked with a little impulse.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by co operator Markus Obert arrived at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to see the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisdale Metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last evening in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. he made the legend proud when he stormed home in order to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after being held in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Hoys's withdrawal only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner prevailed in the qualification round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his turn, Hinder was slightly back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation moving in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," "" "It is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round, we set up an Olympic cord and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 Triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindi said:" "" "it feels like the whole of the GB flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to get back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle rom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape Kenny it is in the realm of possible that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the quickest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record gained gold in London 2012 was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He was arguing yesterday with delegates before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow and ended, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archives of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a flock of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama was in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst sexism and Mobbings and retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle-rom it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the system.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy, set for 20 years, expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa Castle closed the Point Henry melting shop, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's melting shop in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies large aluminium smelting with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp. hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through melting," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL further said that the contracts were" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL expects the contracts in the fiscal year to contribute to revenues," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the revenues at AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecast of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $187 million in" "" "expecting a cancellation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said the decision to book the treaties, the "Alcoas ability... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt" does not affect.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn against the potential closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 MW and Tomago to consume about 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted Septemberance of the US Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché of almost every birthday episode of a children's program (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?", with the honesty of a cartoon on a broadcasting station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of cardamhians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an image volume rather than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista have been advertising from the 832 pages of the Wälzers).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still seep before the official announcement.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she finds herself in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous individuals or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>

<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent over five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just short of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previous 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country parliament.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather palpable.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "came into the shops 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow out of the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as "West pocket format office."</seg>
<seg id="13">Indeed, the new mobile phone could be a lot for those standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit very slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local authorities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrow as well as in 2012 in London when we spent a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and local companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already provide 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blazing on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in sweaty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion of expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, until the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games from 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blogpost in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding about its advertising, to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a Blogpost, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-forth conflict between the pending open source community and the bypassing has been underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicators have become a concern for the industry.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police are calling for witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway during the early morning hours on Thursday during a suspected suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>

<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss lady wanted to kill himself at the age of 49, which was overtaken by several vehicles, including a truck.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, said the police who, as well as any witnesses of the incident, summoned them to report.</seg>

<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "this is something the public prosecutor must decide," "" "said Hofstetter." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases, where a person ran in the dark on the motorway, it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway, as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after passing a man and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the road.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms resembling climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have brought up similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly progressed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus displays its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, similar to evolution, which was previously assumed by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogene withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- Venus which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star cluster as well as in what context the rotational time periods are with the creation of planets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 light years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They turn the fastest now.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these mature stars meet large amounts of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star age, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the occurrence of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars revolving slower than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: thus hackers blackmail her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware Abwehr specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom money required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the sightings of Malwarebytes, the offenders specialize their blackmail software on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to send out ransom will be significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes manager Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was very quick over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a Ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported losses of turnover through ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break off business activity, in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must take part hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share their work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the Anti-Virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more probable, however, that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits have been created by purchasing malware, advice, and additional tools for a one-time fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the boards on the underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then commission spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey have confidence in repairing Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful completion, the perpetrators will instead threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This reduces the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top does not fall off.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "not only a luggage compartment of 453 l is available for folded back rests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a child seat and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, his work should be somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temperature control responds to traffic signs detection and lowers the speed when necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket lie beneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the petrol engine will get from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around eternally, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep far before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes can be attributed to them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wealth, member of the Executive Board of the German Society for sleep and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands by the time being, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. an in- and through sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">As far as sleeping, many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board at the German Medical Association with Practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially frequent in case of depression," "" "said Levin." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors interrupt each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, anyone who has a herniated disc might be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to smile about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of at least three nights a week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises Wealth.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: you are beaten, tired, innocent, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in question.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lowered sleeping medicine is hardly available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first contact your family doctor in case of sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in the sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise doctors, for example, with snoring with respiratory sufferers, in case of sick sleepiness, sleepwalkers, or if you don't find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not make a nap," "" "says Fiesta." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cladding, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera shows the sleeping end on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of locking screws where you can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fire counts: regular sleep and uptime, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you begin to reckon immediately, and that's not good at all.</seg>

<seg id="8">In doing so, they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still a remainder of cobblestones: the Riga-Friedrichshain street does not seem like that at first sight, but the police numbers it to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one goes along the road from east to west, one comes past playgrounds, a fresco-painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's inner senator Henkel has been campaigning several times for a hard police action against the project, called the "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers had been cleared, the police patrogated official statements three weeks later with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, locked up parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the renovation of the building, the premises were commissioned by the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved away under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street appears peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about Vorm Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who holds three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police force between house occupants and their neighbors, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers' district, which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Riga Dome.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under great police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world: residents from the GDR times and former house occupants are now sharing their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga Gallery are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them in discarded discs or freshly painted facades, which were ironed with color pouches.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned so often this year with the words" "" "left-liberal violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like physical injury are reported almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the criminal offences are damages that tend to hit the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not sure.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here, one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer moved to Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important to her that the residents got back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still taken away: by faceless new buildings in former mosquitoes that are displacing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - there are rather people who are not so well polluted," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can one do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of those who are fond of colour bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw near should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub quarter, can complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new Refugee Representative</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the Administration for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the experiencing woollen milklust, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less ridiculing rather than targeted on the multitude of desired areas of activity - meant that the administration wanted to write down the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sought was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long experience in the field of social work, just an unfinished wool milk sow.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, writes Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent stake in three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honouring- and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must place the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the Municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility switches from the district council office to municipality and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work until now, if one relies on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers will soon be set up in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay there are internships, apprenticeships, school courts, one-euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be punged or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity does not only mean labour.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also administration and community of volunteers jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "however, there are problem cases, customer honestly," "" "people with nothing at all" "". "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent occurrences, even in a small congregation such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says quite clearly what some may call naive." "" "a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the assistants are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were bringing them out completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and community officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher have already been utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
