Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s continuing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the Iranian nuclear programme promoted by Obama has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech that was partly considered as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election in Israel at that time .
in an emergency call , Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb had told with a ring@@ ing voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , scri@@ b@@ bled on a white blo@@ c , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff had heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb did the disa@@ strous distress at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb Motiv@@ ated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some tendencies toward easy behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doctorate , which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would represent no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a clas@@ h between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
he received his PhD in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of her long@@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years trying to teach her the guitar .
he was then the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every girl mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and pr@@ el@@ ss were obviously a couple of times together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes an entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on night 5 September last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a memorial candle light ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the Univers@@ itat sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported on Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb did the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an ar@@ cade length of being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest contemporary film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be scre@@ ened on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon states his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys it has ( yet ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask themselves what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising of Mc@@ Cain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative Wirtschafts@@ gruppe Club for Growth realise dr@@ um@@ ps per@@ sever@@ ance and start dropping their dollars to pl@@ unge him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure mid June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ ac vote in I@@ owa concluded last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as a jump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same via Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first electoral nation of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality in order to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 Independent Greeks say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their ven@@ erable hats , republi@@ can vot@@ er Tr@@ ump represent real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since the time four of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters see Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ tear support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally off Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only con@@ tender that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly re@@ mitted their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their opinions are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign nick@@ named &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; two months ago , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump pi@@ vot@@ al His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , there will be Donald Tr@@ ump .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans were frustr@@ ated in Congress by 54 percent , &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell anger@@ ed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea Congress .
in the street , one square meter of a homeless building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern &apos;s dream launch thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double tor@@ ment@@ or in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller pav@@ ing the way for FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milano . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es scored ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received with his 28th results in the Champions League to the Bavarian @-@ leadership kind co @-@ help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ keeper Roberto , who allowed a shot of the World Champion to happen as flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ lov@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ ly @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his latest six home matches in the premi@@ er class , including rep@@ utable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European Cup Du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts they often turned into works .
the attacks were too often initiated by shifting to Lin@@ ks@@ anen , Douglas Costa , which seldom came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympic @-@ storm @-@ stri@@ ker , Ide@@ ye Brown , hit the pole of the Pole by the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct measure , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto saved his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bavaria beha@@ ved as a dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set con@@ i@@ fers .
but at door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was forgiveness .
for instance , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to New York , Guardi@@ ola let a quad@@ ran@@ gle chain with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero first gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports CFO Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , that &apos;s vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their audience blo@@ c apparently provoked the followers of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with striking sticks against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bavaria fan injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam @-@ based long @-@ term study .
good news : if you do not , the risk will drop quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the chance to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
major causes of tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , under@@ lining the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gum infections in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the risk of non @-@ smoking began to decline , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said pup@@ il Director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good oral health until very old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness divided the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter rem@@ n@@ ants from the late anti@@ quity at the Rhine bank of Cologne
archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ n@@ ants of historical buildings near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , &quot; says director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called land monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department of archaeological monument preservation .
in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now been five .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman cap@@ tures freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the train station in the town of Gei@@ sel@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the people to help themselves .
on early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm the woman crossed the railway platform from the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .

EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to elu@@ ci@@ date the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which in its function equivalent much more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de accused him of introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is intended to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely demonstrate that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be made equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators . there was no obj@@ ection to their verdict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications .
for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could then be clari@@ fied there .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required above all by major corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which allows companies to bid for damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act referred to the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it has been critic@@ ised for not being eligible for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a major step forward .
the Commission took into account important points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economy &apos;s action by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
so far , however , investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the timi@@ d singer @-@ singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks about different places he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender arranged songs .
where they came into being and what it looks like , in his homeland .
ever since , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent .
it is rum@@ oured that Mich@@ igan was the first part of a we@@ ary series : each of the 50 states of the United States should follow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhin@@ eland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

although nearly 2,000 guests now sit in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to the in@@ timacy and to the folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can actually throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frame
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected to be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s frame round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to have made his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frame and created for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several front @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the Royal Air Force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of Shadow Mini@@ atures have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party initially supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the British correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour MEPs set out to remove the whole idea of a limit overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he joined T@@ ory &apos;s boss in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box across parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another approach to policy , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s frame of questions is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he is subjected to both &quot; impact &quot; and stri@@ fe with bar@@ bs and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the shelter , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; punch and punch theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s frame . but a few years later he acknowledged that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ aries , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need extensive reforms .

pound climb@@ s through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply to data that showed an increase in wage growth of the United Kingdom . simultaneously , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the bid destination SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est since 2009 , and has given an appreciation of the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index reached an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were higher than encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of his strategy of reducing debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his assessment of the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages are endanger@@ ing expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese on potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both are in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ denburg @-@ burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of the twe@@ eter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da Movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat stuck together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , his shop has a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leban@@ ese had the idea to register at the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also works well with its customers .
met@@ cash starts floor@@ standing campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - invasion
met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ a launched a support campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances will conduct its annual Investor Strate@@ gi@@ et@@ ag .
there is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metal@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states after the opening of its first markets and take away all available players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million sales per year and met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s turnover in the food and food business rose by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting its operational debt reduction with simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios , and according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather deserves praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the in@@ famous confrontation of K@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be split twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have sm@@ ashed K@@ yr@@ gios &quot; and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a crash gr@@ ated a potential US Open win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite excited is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute a little , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z in the important preliminary decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everybody , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick has quickly made the climb , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he deserves all the critic@@ isms he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declares the state of emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a No Man &apos;s Land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who had fled from violence contracted for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants chant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and insul@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest to food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants would be sent back from Hungary , while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ blo@@ c at a disputed meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ run Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a Baltic action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison ins@@ ets were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and has become the entry point to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia for a crime . these laws also set higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency status , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac &apos;s repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , which will be expected next week , but Repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Country Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences committed in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quickly rep@@ airing the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire came to close the borders .
chaos fo@@ stered the most important crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to get in there .
about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands were outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face toward the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the Pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the prim@@ aries start , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say their opinion is determining what candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton maintains a big head over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
your support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders here is only with 5 points back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton has a big head start with the El@@ der voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries of the country would say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled by her .
the views are more powerful among those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about a quarter would inspire them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to become president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and sel@@ f@@ ability are also cited .
as the vice president raises a potential for the president &apos;s office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one @-@ third believes he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
of Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half of them say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before S@@ anders will increase from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure decreased from 78 percent last month .
bi@@ ds are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the constitu@@ tion@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the past month , no democratic candidate or potential candidate for these sel@@ ections of the prim@@ aries is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some important features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
maj@@ orities like Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den rightly cuts off with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being asked as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have deterior@@ ated .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of her party hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes at the lead .
of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but like Car@@ son , many have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in a country survey
Ben Car@@ son is closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is no longer necessary , and others lose a dramatic momentum
Republi@@ can voters still support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under republi@@ can elec@@ torate with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who dropped at the lowest level , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , Y@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son will rise in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent pol@@ l by ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ ves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even more warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) with .
swimming pool temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt arrives at 28 degrees .
five Brotherhood members bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College no@@ vices
almost two years after a student died during a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft Sel@@ ected Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes and was repeatedly attacked while trying to move over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle her symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide and set the f@@ rat@@ ernity of the Brotherhood fundamentally about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning in his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt strength injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sh@@ kan@@ es of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members of Mor@@ el &apos;s third degree .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ment and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also account for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has withdrawn its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in interest comes , and the domestic will be stag@@ gering , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants may find that all the f@@ uss was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , head econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the withdrawal of interest increases can make things more volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be depreci@@ ated 12 to 24 months after the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , in the past 35 years , the market is usually in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal conditions after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent published at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ dered to occur later in the increase cycle and the rate of return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest raises often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that it did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
what is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a raise increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate raises only twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 per cent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest raises in such fragile economic scenery could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
participants have made a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ itation heights were put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticipated interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is quicker than that of shares if they change their strategic direction .
in bonds , yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease is made in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the de@@ vil@@ s stum@@ ble immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns to come closer together between longer and shorter loans and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ consumption bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting to see that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , earnings curve is fl@@ atter , credit spreads increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
large and large companies will benefit from the greater part of their business operations in the United States , when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts will be getting worse as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond exceedingly positively three months after initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed by 5 percentage points on average after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers are likely to see gains through higher yields , even though experts of different opinions are as fast as that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dou@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly unable to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked The Voice and said it was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ enced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which last year started , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously called examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Director General denied the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I will not learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to get involved than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports were under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sts that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
he added that he wants the company to &quot; find a hit out of our in @-@ house stall , &quot; if the next time there was a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent rise in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago thanks to the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed the expenditure in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the record began in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales index .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the after@@ sales revenue .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers ran around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 issues a little over £ 1 was spent online .
in some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia le@@ aks up the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane arrived at Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ z@@ ee .
mour@@ ning people filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to show their respect when the first of the dead stepped on their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession proc@@ eeded to the holy place , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the mos@@ que ceiling and then fell on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi king imposed a sanc@@ tion on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 actuators , who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane declined .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was forbidden .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the grand mo@@ zz@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month .
the bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ opped the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project , which is led by the bin Laden group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over bigger building projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the fall of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other wounded receive half of this amount .

V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led .
King@@ fis@@ her therefore plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that have more feminine single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a UK based in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group ow@@ es the costs for closing the shops .
because of the trend King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ duction .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the def@@ end@@ ants used funds from association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , through which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
he estimated the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial mel@@ ts .
this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the def@@ end@@ ants denied that the association was at no time an asset .
the sports officials had only charged expense allowance and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were confronted with the situation : do we carry on the club further or block us ? &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread profession , told a large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial department .
with his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the brief@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
furthermore , with appropriate financial success , the dis@@ bur@@ sements of the allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , a part of the allowance had been paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump @-@ l@@ ump and not detailed de@@ bu@@ gging appeared , the former chairman explained the events .
the accounts and as@@ cri@@ ptions administered the two def@@ end@@ ants in common , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
the judge asked why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial results , important was only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , a charge of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this statement of securities went to the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , Ju@@ dge and Prosecutor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With whom you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never related a cent salary , he merely charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ end@@ ants .
these were no longer kept after an operation examination , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
he explained in his statement that he had to drive to Blei@@ burg from his hom@@ etown of international market to the bank .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents more 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff reductions , which has been ongoing for three years , the computer will reduce further jobs while spl@@ itting the company .
the power stations of the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall under the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard &apos;s share had 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business units shall be listed on the stock exchange .
a more dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services continued the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under USD 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more businesses online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in comb@@ at@@ ting hos@@ tilities in Iraq was mostly rejected : 54 per cent , on the other hand , cons@@ ented , 35 percent agreed .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 percent , on the other hand , are to intervene in the conflict .
a collaboration with Syrian leader Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad accounts for 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed troops against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Water Li@@ ghts .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water @-@ row@@ er stood ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set mint pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have withdrawn a little while waiting .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ ek@@ ed .
other refugees were sag@@ ging together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US Central Bank comes together two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank could potentially leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , assistant worker at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less strict prospect of global relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death guards at the Delta State University leave ap@@ ologies for ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could und@@ o it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot at any one , and anyone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the employee of the emergency call centre that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it will probably be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police demanded the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 saying , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a clas@@ h between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb had believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt as well , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ st was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ man Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb was awarded a doctorate in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , as his CV gives on the university website .
stars that have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drugs .
all this is certainly requ@@ esting its purpose .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group by
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will cost the conversion of the Group to the workplace .
there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings tri@@ l@@ lion .
the target of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the board for the passenger business in future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings will be responsible for managing director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Pass@@ enger Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations for the court @-@ stopped strike on this Thursday will be resum@@ ed in the tari@@ ff conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) .
that was what the union announced .
the topic of talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit hopes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as possible to deliver sustainable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline led to a number of strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilot , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept is background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it fores@@ ees that Lufthansa flights to the Eu@@ row@@ ings low @-@ cost airline in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double fac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered twice the frac@@ ture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outer defender to tears and exclu@@ des him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very heavy and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared to be happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet sent to Sha@@ w &apos;s account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V defeat
the England advoc@@ ate has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg quar@@ ry when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know what it feels like , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ abel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nicely and well except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead returns a summary of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss was listening to Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but totally unknown .
as if it were not yet suspect enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially reading like the summary of the lau@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits himself to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , hears , despite the protests of the nam@@ es@@ ake Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , stub@@ born being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ side .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali has developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th dies from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
in his seven tests there were two good ass@@ aults under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that pocket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton scored nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to move back and forth .
the only reproach that one can raise was that England first translated Jonathan Des@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a whi@@ p I put on high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , what hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting Mo@@ een cook next to Cook , which provides an extra spin @-@ bowl and got four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t mind anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a min@@ stre@@ l can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed one has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ een perhaps didn &apos;t do his job for his county of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my previous te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred p@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ ee , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est fel@@ lows of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh breeze even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem with it for my part .
some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light hear@@ ted .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = withdrawal of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy was in a sl@@ ur@@ ry by 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ expressed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper with every day , even without the choice of ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n became the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was sharply divided over Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at re@@ affir@@ med that some member states are so deeply frustr@@ ated in various crises , such as the EU , and not always on their own debt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
prime minister and finance ministers climb on summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes a Great Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and civil servants have come to the point in some capitals to whether we remain or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long out@@ ages like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy is better used to prevent Scottish withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that is why some such ministers may even plan intentionally not helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 , in order to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press sal@@ ons , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can easily recall Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ad ban@@ an &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
in all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , for Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the cute Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , an error at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC &apos;s sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I say it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional dy@@ e @-@ off tendency and the wild bo@@ ilers of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ men can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio , and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as Shadow Law was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet @-@ mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties on Monday evening after all reports on their cl@@ auses .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like this .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite occupation economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic conten@@ tions .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less damaging than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , partially linked to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy fund@@ ament &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ criterion decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) analysis to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received after reports before by the Tob@@ acco Company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are included , some of which also include an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the P@@ he tab@@ ak management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sign @-@ proof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products damage to most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less damaging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soy .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for placing public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ disputed time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea of sending or sending BBC programs that would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee in his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the radio fee , which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad their support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financing programs could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erly is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I have to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows reflect what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ erly should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; go to BB@@ C4 , where you can fairly not measure the audience , but they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of radio toll@@ s , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
for the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course , all of us think that we all think that there is a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 I wonder if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Tuesday Committee , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; educ@@ ate , train and maintain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , clarify and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful on TV will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to enter alli@@ ances to make all available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by erup@@ tions of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound pulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pulses operate through the switching on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aphrag@@ m channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms discovered the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , cardiac and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani realized that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the cube cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms where they turn on the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neur@@ ons on and off with pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Sizegenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which must be sent down to the desired position in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the Waffen@@ platz - and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains to be stronger through the blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to talk : people tell from where you come from , where and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were set on fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people do it .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and community meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t forget to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space baking culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have expen@@ ded on interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a milit@@ ant is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it a SMS instead of kno@@ cking on it .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my dormit@@ ory students had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the university at the height of back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome from the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and may end up associ@@ ating your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbors if it was something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour exam .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go back to her , dis@@ associate herself and then see her every day and perhaps see her coming up with all mutual friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is more fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling any more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single persons , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert builds town@@ houses for people who do not have much money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build still cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a great deal .
in view of the current flow of refugees , we also need plenty of living space for the next few decades .
a fully ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when you put people into blocks of living .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
the houses can then be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building codes have complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have properly tra@@ m@@ pled my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly complicated is the threatening Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ compl@@ i special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ tage regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still subject to who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three plots .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but don &apos;t you tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message saying that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps in order to create space - but Apple has made this more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update , and it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may turn on half way and this could lead to abor@@ tion of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which Alfred Klein received .
thus it is possible to record players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent for talent are also to be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district office looks for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined forces under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from consultations one can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation draws it from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
from now on , directly next to the purchase market , the elderly and the counsel@@ ing will receive information on questions such as health care insurance or services provided by the health and nursing staff .
for years , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that often maintaining relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many benefits of insurance companies are not rarely used , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new managing director J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a business area manager for the elderly and the hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both managers see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
because this requires a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ scored in the opening ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by doing so , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ year passed away
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ yen of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus held on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus loses an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .

he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design from 1972 to 1983 .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg in Vienna and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz into the Austrian Theatre Museum .
Park@@ ed : Tim Wiese re@@ jects police officer with money
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese has fallen ill in Bremen .
foot@@ ball@@ ers were once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , ex @-@ national guards in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim are engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not intellec@@ tually agree .
Wiese had just cut the hair in the downtown of Bremen when he saw the outside of a parking space guard representing a pen@@ al for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , Wiese rus@@ hed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the bureau@@ cra@@ t and accused her of the due penalty in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
with the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states it from the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men are fighting for 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , according to the police followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men shou@@ ted to the young man and struck him with his fist into the face .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ al bone frac@@ ture and bleeding heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator persecuted the group with a passenger car to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed many times there .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the last one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
using a beat @-@ stick , one beat on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only one vag@@ ue description of the perpet@@ rators .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been 1.@@ 65 m tall and was clothed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks for witnesses and advis@@ ors to report on the phone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ breaks .
furthermore , mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on hand for his successor in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the office on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises on St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to get into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the pleasure of married couple Müller to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in voluntary work in the DRC &apos;s willingness to become Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September onwards , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as general practitioners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of € 50,000 is given to the mill@@ ers as part of a funding programme of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Mr@@ s Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of rock breaks every quarter , about 500 in the North German average practice .
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy stays in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel &apos;s Fel@@ ter@@ breaks .
if no successor had been found , she would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours , by the way , continue to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical staff and the cleaning power of the rock formation .
with their f@@ arewell to A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel &apos;s cliff @-@ breaks with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the long period of time , she already felt a little sad@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will see many patients quite often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always been afraid of gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also lifted up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mic@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum request can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , not even the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave the incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , however , the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia has already been severely insp@@ ected as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
as the minister pointed out , Slovenia does not want to break its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees in eastern Croatia had already tried to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , ever since , police vehicles with new refugees gather in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly dealing with Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously crossed migrants to the Hungarian border , would conver@@ ge in Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it is the people who approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; it was said .
according to media reports , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the border town of S@@ id in the morning , further buses would be expected in the course of the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border of Macedonia , which was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , it could indeed lead to the predicted shift of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat higher @-@ west distance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen Member had &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently witnessed a good report concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently deal with very high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked with Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : there are still no cleared min@@ e@@ fields in parts of the border region 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .
be@@ eper @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have listened to a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having provided insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire ever since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , in@@ sider trading should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are said to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .

keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , bla@@ zing life with beautiful autumn sun and in the middle of four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively responded to her 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Joseph@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spontaneously reach the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ m my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others will be short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again , there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ac@@ onal Church Mannheim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is jointly with the Car@@ itas Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that everyone does not want to share on the boards publicly is understandable , but after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Joseph@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has greatly contributed to the opening of the people .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , think it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lower prospect is despite the price increases , which is 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher rates for boun@@ ce shipments of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings if one considers weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the analysts predicted twelve by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analy@@ st questioned by Z@@ ack expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex filed a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex .
in the last quarter , net sales increased 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher operating costs in freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 US $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected convention in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at the end of the decorated two @-@ storey meeting hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ time order from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here is stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy &apos;s data show that it is growing solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the estate agency Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate increase this week .
but the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the beat by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy will sustain the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ sky , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rise in interest would ease the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty as to when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives reported that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and need it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage ratio fell by more than 16 % in May under its highest level as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would spro@@ ut global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , the Dow is now around 10 % below the high of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should be technically not included in decision @-@ making .
but in the end the world has become the F@@ ed Currency Board .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere reference to the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; its monetary expansion , caused del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA commented on this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ actions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
acqu@@ er , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest increase , quoted Dec@@ isions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives und@@ ressed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 financial sl@@ ump , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholes@@ aler selling to the general public .

there is even a car department when you need engine oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the courses .
if the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this shop lies close to the cash des@@ ks and has various withdrawal options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and fil@@ e@@ ate the fish and even fry on request for you .
a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freeze section . here you will find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ al , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blood and g@@ all , pork kn@@ ut , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more .

where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the engagement of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with her body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 differences .
every Thursday she does it in the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite a different lesson than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nour@@ ishment for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to inform women in shock@@ ing fashion how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the application for the € 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ halle Project at the Bern@@ ried sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
among other things , the body had previously decided to apply for a construction @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; liberation &quot; from the prevailing development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the permission was given for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ standard first and roof over@@ hangs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be constructed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again the roof inclin@@ ation , which is supposed to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan was not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with respect to the tendency of the roof - although the Bern@@ ese municipal council is generally more restric@@ tively involved in deliver@@ ance orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the hall building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million Euros are calculated at a cost .
subsidies are expected from school and mass transport .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will be presented to the Federal Council for Ex@@ am@@ ination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff moved from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the administrative unit of the county , who confirmed the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , the Supervisory Board meets a decision , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the almost 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the existing internal ward to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital since the beginning of the year , has recently started to switch to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who to succeed him , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October onwards and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in each case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inner ward .
for the next two years , fis@@ her with his team , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar@@ s , which still has 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , responded to rum@@ ours that the House , owned by the Federal Ar@@ med Forces , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care for Car@@ itas and a daily hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has not been a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has worked as chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ ball of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .

Jag@@ late with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police told .
a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were put into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the criminal police are investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a police officer has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , who have been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and thrown their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosec@@ utor and the police in wed@@ n@@ esday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old who was also captured on Tuesday evening was considered to be an active participant who , according to the information , admitted the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after visiting an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first launched personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
when questioned in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , according to the authorities , the police inter@@ ro@@ gated the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him on a charge .
the further investigations should bring about the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are looking for affordable stay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which grows bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compl@@ ains .
many professionals therefore dwelt in large cities in need of living in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed for longer in &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flu@@ ffy on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has dropped for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Res@@ idential Development &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing .
this means that the property tax will be dispens@@ ed with and the land tax will be temporarily suspended for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats .
in addition , attractive tax depreciation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee camps by the Kf@@ W ( State Bank of State Bank ) is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the Euro 300 million had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary , since more and more refugees are choosing the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws which entered into force on the same day also make regular asylum procedures in Hungary redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border with the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the border of the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t b@@ ump into f@@ ences .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closing of the border , hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police en@@ listed 3@@ 66 un@@ challenged people .
shortly before closing the gate on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
prisoners are threatened with imprisonment up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; set up at the border , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees had stopped there .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the tr@@ ash that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side during the past few weeks .
locking grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the recordings in the border town has been reconstructed .
no one wanted to express itself for the purpose of this modification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government information .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing some smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge celebration on Sunday we were busy with ti@@ dying when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Werner mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had suddenly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we have once again cho@@ os@@ ed the unexpected guests , with jam and drinks .
we have said the same thing , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers changed to a regional train in W@@ els from one ICE to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , in order to try it after the short notice that the rail traffic was stopped in Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday , a two @-@ bridge @-@ run spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly brid@@ ged the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of National Socialism .
suff@@ erer of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ oultry will also have to find out that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing influ@@ x of refugees and approaching winter , to produce decent states for vulnerable people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ fixed quarters
Konrad , with the help of refugees , has to do all his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first reception centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the placing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without large vor@@ tex , said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects 8@@ 5.000 quarters in he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next weeks - 20.000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s no barrel without floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial governor .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the upcoming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ coordinator puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that quarter owners have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holders or the size of the top duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a limited time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , is more successful with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not give the Republic any cost as they themselves stated .
their number of employees wants to increase them to three to four .
the own quest for lod@@ g@@ ings has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the placing of refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because the suffer@@ ers are currently unable to submit these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , other locations should be tested for their suitability .
the City Council comm@@ its criticism to the breakdown of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday acqu@@ itted the further procedure in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continued use of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available .
however , the seek@@ ers of protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also carries out controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line has been officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T is moved into , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) should be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later also acquiring some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
J@@ utta Br@@ eit actually wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade . after all , she has now grown into a further local area .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greater Linz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten Br@@ eit from her dam into the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can &apos;t answer the specialist woman with last security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag upgrades every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property also connects some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , shaking journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US pres@@ idency inspir@@ es the campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker finds a term to many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant place is related to him about nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become a most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would be successful also if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the King of the hearts .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high German : the investors , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later Grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate group was first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed on the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record cl@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in stark contrast to the sometimes striking say@@ ings of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the polar , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so generous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension econom@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that from Donald &apos;s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 Kin@@ o@@ gän@@ ger , also in the US is awakening interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park on Wednesday received the award for soft tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the today show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son make ha@@ ste to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there have not been any major shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull received Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s fall .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the uprising seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals , compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sunrise was closed during the last few months .
in August , Today , Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance went between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now , Sunrise is at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ ster star Rebec@@ ca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor von Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree that Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood ends in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before from three two , you might have inad@@ vert@@ ently gave an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive the last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood from the first day had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw it with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condi@@ tionally tuned to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests for his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco @-@ 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ bles on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t @-@ return and also to the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Mr. Hay@@ ne also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Sports repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his lost catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the rac@@ er with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

the free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ red@@ ger warned us of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ red@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get obstruc@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Day Question is held in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , completely different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ red@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the 1990 wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Selec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ red@@ ger also asked more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum cases : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ keepers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ red@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy in the city of Gros@@ sw@@ amp should not fall under the table .
a long lasting burner is on the order of the day : education policy .
for the new school year , Ministry of Education , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Sec@@ ondary Level plus &quot; at 47 secondary schools , with an extension of the secondary school from three to four years .
but Ai@@ red@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

fix Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
the German stock market closed with profits after a long @-@ haul and nervous trade show .
only in the afternoon was a festive opening of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which finally promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ DA@@ X average value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

in the US , the Dow Jones Index has recently noted about 1 percent in the plus .
many stock markets expect markets to be replaced until after the interest rate decision in the US and on fut@@ ures trading on fut@@ ures markets .
the discussion about the loads arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep traces even with E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may be lacking 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures stated in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in future @-@ based wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold off than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA instructed for the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a public servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then poured into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to be capable of killing , but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal on the southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ul@@ ites say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 polic@@ emen , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled by centuries for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ st@@ ened the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new Constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the site at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post shall be re@@ inst@@ ated .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alization of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den city wants to market an area of around 4000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Alte Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
wait for appropriate offers , that is , on the part of the city .
which investor has come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were concluded .
the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , bought already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday settlement on the Small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor creates publicly plans for the project for the first time .
some li@@ eger are still wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their leisure agent
for months it was negotiating , practi@@ sed , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now the plans for a new holiday house on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council City Development Committee .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investors and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ick went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project &apos;s ten to twelve million euro projects have been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among the owners of the sea , which had come to the meeting , highlighted the images and new details of the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea bu@@ d owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cla@@ z over@@ looked by all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics , that the traffic would increase enormously due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come so that this pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good one hectare site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches double donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( C@@ f . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European Nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announc@@ ing the call for donations on his blog .
instead of making a manager announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes compared to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ infected the disease and partially at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was partially dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results of the checks of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad LD@@ L Cholester@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the Senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater dec@@ lines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and characterized rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy patients in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is lying between 27 and 30 with his BM@@ I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated such genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is an issue that is currently increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story the novel should be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama engaged Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kl@@ ing the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama respon@@ ds to the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase in ing@@ es@@ tion of hand dis@@ infection by children over the last 4 years
toxic control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age consuming strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection drugs , thus Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reported from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children intentionally drink dis@@ infection products while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly mixed dis@@ infection with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infection ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially in small children .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the tox@@ in emergency center in K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer in reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six year old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after Stra@@ w@@ berry sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally regarded as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ chie , a emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah slept their words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency room .
doctors watched them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and had pushed his head , said Rit@@ chie .
&quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ ti@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ables and store han@@ di@@ ect@@ treatments outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario attacked women after swal@@ lowing hand dis@@ infection products containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
people of health authorities suggest that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol which has been recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York State planned to poison their &quot; painted &quot; teacher by setting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ infection and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police investigated the a@@ eg@@ ged plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
at a rear @-@ end collision between Nordr@@ ing and On Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about industrial area and took too late to notice that at the round@@ about two preceding vehicles had stopped .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle to a standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
the police took part in the accident involving vehicles of about 10 000 Euros .
the Audi of the 33 year old was no longer ready to ride and had to be tow@@ ed off .

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m @-@ games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Cel@@ tic &apos;s fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ am to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it this way - but we must go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the stri@@ ker and added : &quot; it is safe to say that I will not return to Ty@@ n@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot;
tann@@ ing Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Management Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back on tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to be &quot; un@@ attractive &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ In@@ es conc@@ edes that his team of Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points before Cel@@ tic at the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in cups or le@@ agues that have not won games of that kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it increases overall in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the U@@ K@@ s , as showed the figures of the National Statistics Office ( O@@ NS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken stor@@ ks disturbed the process
since the security staff failed to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officers could take the stur@@ geon in custody .

why I am witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except in late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
the invitation was issued for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that she could &quot; better form@@ ulate it , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ yar@@ n , a repor@@ ter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can contact for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase is persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
p@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to shut down the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer attempting to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was founded on Tuesday for a breach of domestic peace in Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn &apos;t too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy says ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy says ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they launched a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ g sample at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything will come out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head raised , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard R@@ V@@ L , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it will become personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there think that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has mistakenly put mud on my leg .
it could have been like this yesterday evening .
it could have been like the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy back against ri@@ vals because of claims about ring fights
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised Tac@@ kl@@ ing its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ees allowed the storm @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high @-@ storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team , after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team totally agree to him as it meant they were worried about being hit by the storm team .
&quot; it always shows up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we did not change our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . however , over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focus , and this has provided a trend revers@@ al for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he &apos;ll take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm Against R@@ oo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in a phase .
the Storm team is free to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ d@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit after drugs deposit
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long penalty for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to have a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole crowd and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a 200,000 dollar security represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and stops at an exit lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
Audi accident at Karlsruhe : leader house torn apart
a truck driver was seriously injured in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police told .
the cab of the accident causing outbreak was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 a.@@ m .
a damage was incurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ t used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg recorded the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the be@@ wil@@ dering news and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care and saw the five images , then analy@@ zing computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research , which used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer were done by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wants to see images of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused &apos;s computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty as part of the indictment , to have taken up in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
def@@ end@@ ant Greg@@ or S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders since one could argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael bl@@ amed up the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted b@@ ail in this case but was held in provisional custody on charges of other pending cases .
he was still admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
locks smooth to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up on the German @-@ Austrian border away from the major control points .
many locks left people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings because of fear of discovery and arrest .
out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn River Inn and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic @-@ guns on the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the beginning of the week , more and more refugees met at Munich Central Station in comparison to the beginning of the week .
about 700 people arrived in the capital city alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest awaiting
meteor@@ ologists are warning of storm bre@@ en in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart has been contributing to the country &apos;s warm ocean air .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who had moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected primarily in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , on Thurs@@ days also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er circle with bends of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday you can see the sun again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years the motor@@ ways show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is above all moving to the compact cars that are currently selling particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone , according to the German Federal Ministry of Transport ( KBA ) alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( September 17 to 27 ) .
many new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel is entering the world &apos;s largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as five @-@ door .
the second version will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what next to the Astra on the IAA is yet another compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporty GT version .
in the trade , he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan un@@ loader will find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
on offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s indications in 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put a hand at the front end : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants are also available at the IAA in the compact class , such as the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied
the Federal Constitutional Court has issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the law enforcement agency Te@@ gel , who had been accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
due to the violation of their human dignity , the prisoners basically are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a private cell with approximately five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that the man , who is now on his free foot according to his lawyer &apos;s instructions , had been moved to a larger cell .
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Berlin Land failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of App@@ eal and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity offen@@ ded .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest were decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
thus , in April , they spoke damage to a prisoner , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had reached a prisoner in a parallel case in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons in Berlin have also hit the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even in fights , it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ au , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to junior lack , 19 are to be dis@@ car@@ ded in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do in Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accept one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated strong determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as before ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing est@@ ates from the rental price relationship , and for these particularly favorable residen@@ ces , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the promotion of funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : about 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise and the Con@@ federation would have to invest a grant of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial that they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the application society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Bon@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ u@@ ck@@ hardt , there has been a political revers@@ al : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence obligation that restric@@ ts asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
in society , too , because of the shortage of skilled labour , there has been a majority in view that refugees should be allowed faster access to the labour market .
a major barrier to access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , in the opinion of Thr@@ us@@ hardt , the Royal Road to the integration of labor .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is only important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ vic , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s sen@@ ate administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the cas@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes for the lessons .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ afford from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but abandoned his stance .
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or cancellation do not receive any services after the asylum application law if they start studying .
the latter generally do not get a bow , since they do not fall under the circle of people entitled to discrimination .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this range will be reduced to 15 months .
but these financing gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get af@@ ö@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an association of Islamic welfare that professionally takes care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
those who wanted to prosec@@ ute such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will hen@@ ce@@ forth be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
as a result , the majority society will have to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent .
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination centre for a decade and a general equality law .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed how the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany require , must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical assistance to the refugees so far awa@@ ited , writes doctor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards right away .
services provided could be settled later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to pick up so many people with the limited product catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors mainly make the language barriers created .
as early as so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting more informed about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in hospitals , also in medical practices that interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
but many refugees would also be helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more untreated disorders among refugee children , and with young people it is about HIV education .
with the partially other illnesses German physicians come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of health , the refugees may even see relief from the point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , several refugees were even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therapy sp@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study at the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee fund is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer , among other things , the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fear@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically sick seek@@ ers of asylum in the social offices can apply for a psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for the psychological diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
ring invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the arena on the brick of the v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Tibetan woman and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of current man@@ e production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for enthusiasts is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of the cir@@ cus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily take up .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words , they identify .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ ae , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with f@@ rat@@ ern@@ ess and ag@@ ility .
balance on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yuan .
snake men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are all too often subject to different animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also commented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read off the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to enter the arena .
the first commandment therefore : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid JU@@ MB@@ O , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether it &apos;s five or a 200 people , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst takes place from 17th to 20th of September at 5 pm and 8 pm to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also asser@@ ted by alleg@@ ations of MEPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with his voice .
last month they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them of interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members concerned that the immunity is in the Parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the belief that tightly focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the wounded Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain at the European Championship .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had severely stopped the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries that he had previously had .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries has been investigating 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 li@@ gam@@ ents in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which recorded most of the infrin@@ gement days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s rice , but ar@@ senal thinks that an improvement in the injury rate will last over the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a time period when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career out of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea in Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta could start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow players who need a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorites are to continue through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was struck by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal drew the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven from distant hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m Camp@@ a@@ ign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication @-@ led communication with a focus on style above substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , fun @-@ loving and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominant .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one by interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments with football watching in cozy arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how a member of the telephone pastoral ministry explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are hom@@ icide end@@ lessly showed me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meeting to help PS@@ G to gr@@ ind Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria will make his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass over to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani maintained course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French Master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris takes a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even though there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; says Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not score one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who could take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was str@@ ung with a five @-@ man defense and two deeply in the mid@@ field str@@ ung a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ rel@@ l in the 3@@ 4th minute they offered little in advance .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some absen@@ ces and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who finished in the first half alone at no less than five attempts alone after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c to turn Di Maria into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth place of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result down before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the skill games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ by share sales
the Gl@@ en@@ core mining giant in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday by a stock sale as part of its huge debt collection plan .
the London company Gl@@ en@@ core declared in an explanation that it has sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .

the company sold its new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by roughly half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola prevented turning to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously in front of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i a few years ago , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league , four times champion league champi@@ ons , twice champion world champion , twice champion champion , twice champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona 24 years ago and changed to Qatar to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing before the European Championships in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça was selling me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t , &quot; he tells .
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass , the reds turned out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated King &apos;s victory triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front Afgh@@ an film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown in discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it by filling the film and not with the instrumentation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian strongly affir@@ med .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to handle the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of Dear White People chose Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film directing rights ; Dam@@ on replied that her directing &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed anger about the clip , saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 lists since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide effect and urged the legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured interference .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life albums , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned the first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which ended its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant completing all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the grand Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he beats any anger about it .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aking over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they once were one of the best bas@@ eball teams , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfect on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins used a chance to climb inside one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , even only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad A@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to put an end to this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ ps every game , and therefore I want to go totally concentrated in the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the head@@ board well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aus@@ m said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked clearly better in the bul@@ l@@ p , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton terminated the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy handed over the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run in front of the righ@@ th@@ man Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit Double Play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth house , Wall created an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed person , however , looks for S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth @-@ Save .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of a Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es , who was not mo@@ tion@@ able yet .
the tig@@ ers scored three races in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I have wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z launched Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he hasn &apos;t struck very well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the relief right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the throwing shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder loos@@ ening , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is stri@@ cken from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing from the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three targets at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it estimated 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived in Hessen , according to the government pres@@ idency responsible for the first recording .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military actions in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ectively looking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military involvement in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is landing at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , Austria has also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening at the Austrian broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and German representatives .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong wave of refugees in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the office of the Chancellor in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection , would get them too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this opinion was expressed unanim@@ ously in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania should also be fenced with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
spatial probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s full moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean sw@@ ings .
this is done by researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
thus the moon pi@@ er@@ ced slightly on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous firm cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a Communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ic@@ e@@ vul@@ can@@ es of Saturn &apos;s South Pole in 2006 , which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama was missing in 1860 Munich several weeks ago
the 1860 München must ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama , an active actor , for about a month .
the association announced an investigation of an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama had already lam@@ ented over pain in the beginning of the week .
according to Munich lions the diagnosis is &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ about loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it , &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ yar@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ profit professional .
the 1960s , however , initially presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ h@@ unter Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie can return to the team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to go into running training .
O@@ ko@@ tie settled in the game near Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at the head .
contrary to the first concerns , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits therefore support the immune system , the immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel @-@ color alone does not tell you how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads , such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and radic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up until Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can reach up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and in some places , and even or@@ kan@@ ers of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday winds blow @-@ blow drying for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture begins to st@@ ow at the mountain slope .
this is where rain begins , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be calculated to the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours .
on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n leaves the air , the result is a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind blows up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back considerably .
the following days are present in the north of autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it gets sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino on Wednesday a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ formers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied for by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith in the city of Pop@@ es over the centuries .
in a symbolic way , the square became visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith was welcomed in Rome .
as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) rose to Rome for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city at that time as a rotten tree of sin .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions will have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his theses against ab@@ lation .
hammer Arti@@ sts invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the golden crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt works on his bi@@ ble project for which he has taken a subj@@ ectively @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds and fa@@ therhood .
thus he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and here is the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so into today , translated into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education has been done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to do so , perhaps to bear my father &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of pic@@ torial worlds is characterised by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced there .
artists have another desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; I am a din@@ osau@@ r in this respect . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , to let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I have not taken care to completely capture the Bible , but have chosen the topics that are important to him as well .
&quot; this was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler , Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans made , place , companies engaged , Erd@@ hü@@ gel mod@@ elled for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway this was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured enjoyment , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hills seclu@@ ded , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was received in October , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to inform Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ li@@ ga is making a clear sign on the weekend .
the soccer respon@@ ds to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its aid in tac@@ kl@@ ing the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest every individual to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. E@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would like to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will &quot; help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports director Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football @-@ Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championship against Hungary on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license ver@@ ters had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will jointly with the DF@@ B @-@ selection and the German government provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the total amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye with a fall in early July .
after the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water glass , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out on the road - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday Edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Sp@@ are pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen other than combat ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen twe@@ eted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was thrown off the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reservation main@@ tain@@ er for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button on weekends , just as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ lows in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem eleven on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change in the door @-@ keeper &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of Chief Apostle Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tu@@ ch@@ el left open , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European league games in the future .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ mid@@ able statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final cat@@ suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , says mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; that &apos;s not the wrong way for Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will improve road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which come together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
among other things , the transport ministry &apos;s strategy paper highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise to digital radio communications .
for testing new technology there is currently a test track on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany , for example , wants to apply international efforts to raise the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to advoc@@ ate a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany by 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly .
however , the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey by the For@@ sa Institute presented on the AA on Wednesday is the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not anticipate that 31 per cent believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed expect auto @-@ driving cars up to 20@@ 25 , 33 percent in the United States .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after receiving the digital ban of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire drive on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least envis@@ age 15 per cent , at a traffic jam of 45 per cent .
every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to the car .
B@@ oll dischar@@ ges team and double start at table tennis championship
according to current status , the Düsseldorf region will only take up the title for the title fight between September 25 and October 4 .
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship appointment in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the Cab@@ inet in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; back then Timo had been missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the fifth @-@ fifth of the world rank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has made a serious injury to the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the def@@ enders were hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis was pointed out by Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ och &apos;s 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , in the meantime it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Om@@ stei@@ g to Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is fortunate that the designer has changed his initially lo@@ aning attitude towards a vision of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort was practi@@ sed : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged specifically .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tonnes of material in Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exhibition shows also Gau@@ l@@ tier old Ted@@ dy .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put clothes on his t@@ ed@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later joined the designing of fashion myself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he didn &apos;t pay the models for his first fashion show .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in great quantities for customers , who , for example , processed them for blankets and she@@ ers .
that alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion played a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , and was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ Industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
jam P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and to the US .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer has said of the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that year we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg out@@ post of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a couple of years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball point .
in doing so , the machine ch@@ okes little balls in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ dry Sp@@ itz - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and would like to have a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um of memory .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more widely for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to be wider out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should invest in attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the guide group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of great importance , as it gives the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legally @-@ state business environment and making the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
the government will also l@@ ure controls on powers deleg@@ ated to companies and make sure companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimizing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes and thus expect consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the tox@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU job , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missed industry and environmental policies are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are today so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limits , some 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in return for this l@@ ure , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ ps , are usually so low poll@@ uted that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction , which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metall for humans , which is strongly enriched in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in un@@ born injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury primarily enters the environment by burning coal .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had cited the concentration of mercury in fish@@ ings such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had cited from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
