B ) i ) The organisation demands only the minimum level of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on equipment shall be restricted to the minimum level , which is necessary for the use of securing measures in relation to core material , which is subject to the securing measures under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) On request of the Community , the organization is ready to examine investment data , which considers the Community to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not require the organization to be transferred materi@@ ally , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community without further access . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization brings the consent of the Community and States to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the States .
&quot; II ) En@@ er@@ ates the community either against a proposed nam@@ ing , or at some time against a new nam@@ ing , so the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization which are imp@@ eded by this Convention , the Council shall discuss the refusal to meet with the aim of taking appropriate measure . &quot;
( B ) The Community and the affected States undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization may actually be able to perform their tasks according to their agreement .
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organisation are set up in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the Community and the States and for the peaceful nuclear activities that are subordin@@ ate to the inspec@@ tions are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other the inspec@@ tors of the organisation for the knowledge of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , to carry out tasks according to the Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the Privileg@@ es and Liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures of this Convention are terminated in relation to core material when the community and the organization establish that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a manner that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able for nuclear activities , which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this agreement , the organization noti@@ fies the Organization for the transfer of core material from the states , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention are terminated in relation to core material as soon as the receiver state , as provided in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the shared core material . &quot;
&quot; in the event of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , the Community is agreed with the organisation of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated according to this agreement in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons in the duration of non @-@ application of the securing measures under this Convention .
B ) The organization and the Community ensure that the securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such activity .
the regulation is set as far as possible as long and under what circumstances these security measures should not be applied .
&quot; in any case , the security measures fores@@ een in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization shall be kept on the running of the total quantity and the composition of this material in the state or the states concerned and on any transfer of such material out of this state or to these states .
&quot; this explains its consent as swi@@ f@@ tly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a hidden knowledge of the military activity , and does not refer to the success of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States bear the costs that each of them will grow in carrying out their respective obligations arising out of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the States or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , but extra@@ ordin@@ arily cost as a result of a special search of the organization , the organization ref@@ uses to reimbur@@ se these costs , unless it has been so en@@ vis@@ aged in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the States . &quot;
any claim that the Community or State shall asser@@ t against the organization or the organization against the association or any state due to damage - except for damages from a nuclear incident - which resulted from the implementation of the securing measures under this Convention will be governed in accordance with international law .
&quot; after review by the General Director , the Council shall establish that the organization must not be able to verify itself by checking that no nuclear material , which must be subject to safety measures under this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Articles of Association and if applicable also the other measures fores@@ een there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the security measures used , provides the Community or the State - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
consultations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention on request of the organization or community or state shall be consul@@ ted .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any dispute , according to Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another by the organization , the Community and the States shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States design@@ ate two refer@@ ees , the organization also names two refer@@ ees , and the four appointed arbitr@@ ator choose a fifth , who will pres@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not appointed two refer@@ ees after the request for an arbitr@@ ator , the Community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbit@@ rators . &quot;
the same procedure applies if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been selected within thirty days of appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Panel shall be competent , and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Panel are binding for the Organisation , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the Treaty and are members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
II ) if the organization of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in respect of this state for the purposes of this Convention .

a ) This Convention shall enter into force the day in which the organization of the Community and States receives the written notification of its procedures for the entry into force .
B ) This agreement remains in force as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable in the execution of the Part I provisions on securing measures as necessary .
the aim of the procedures for securing measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the turno@@ vers of significant quantities of nuclear nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the det@@ err@@ ent of such a junction by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , material book@@ keeping is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the audi@@ ts by the organization is carried out by means of an explanation , where the material quantity for each material balance zone is specified for a specific time period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified amounts . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their investigations , the organization is making full use of the safety system of the community after article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in applying their security measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , will see how they are near@@ er determined and beneficial in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock of distant core material and stock levels ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Procedure for determination , testing and assessment of differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ; &quot;
e ) Procedure for the evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system which displays the core material inventory and the changes in this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
provisions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Procedure for reporting reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this Convention do not extend to material in mining or in the treatment of ores .
&quot; B ) The material , which has not yet been reached in the states under letter c ) , will be introduced into the states , so the community of organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material unless specifically non @-@ nuclear causes are introduced ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear @-@ fuel cycle , thus it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material among the pre@@ conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not accepted or desirable , the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community realize that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures to this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , of these securing measures , provided the entire core material quantity liber@@ ated in the states at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special fol@@ dable material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is less than 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ a , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ ve@@ fold squar@@ ed of the enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) total ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; dischar@@ ged core material together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under this Convention , shall be processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are made on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the Organisation Compl@@ ementary agreements , which are required for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organisation according to this Convention , in the individual as defined in the Convention stipulated in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without any amend@@ ment to the Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the States . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organisation will continue to provide a summar@@ ized inventory of the underlying material material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory by following the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imp@@ eded by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the purpose of the EEC and the Member States , that the entire contribution made by Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle binding to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC organization has presented a table from which it is clear in which way it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name of &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; , &quot; which members of the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ akers &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest recei@@ v@@ ables of the member state , which are paid upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organization as a manager of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited at the organization of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
( B ) Payment shall take place in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the contribution of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at another time between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates upon request .
&quot; according to the standard procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the debt notes to cover expenses for the loan and to compens@@ ate for the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; when gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the EEC regulations : &quot;
( III ) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without any per@@ sever@@ ance ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each loan loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is a loan program of the organization , or not , according to the procedures and practices prescribed for the purpose of endor@@ sement by the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction must not be used instead of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are subject to a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , the loan terms are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which are generally applicable to the loan granted to the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in the age of ten free years . &quot;
&quot; loan loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that re@@ tains them .
&quot; each loan agreement is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the funds is given . &quot;
&quot; the proceeds from each loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or produced ( ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special action loan at the time of loan granted . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker is instruc@@ ted by the EEC as to the completion of all the loans granted for the audit by the directors in preparation and on the projects and programs approved by the directors .
&quot; during the period of payment of the special loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EE@@ A quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures required for this purpose . &quot;
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organisation a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction , the administrator of the EE@@ TS transfers a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are evident from the accounts payable to the bank account and the payments paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the means of action from time to time result in an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special action statements and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation have to agree , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it shall be due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of capital invested by the recipients in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement is returned and re@@ mitted to the Member States , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fying the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings in question .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these not@@ fications with an Not@@ i@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of entry of the mentioned Not@@ i@@ fications upon the Organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each wor@@ ding is equally binding . &quot;
considering that the agreement should be concluded in the form of a change of correspondence to change the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ CE RE@@ LA@@ TION@@ S :

&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom also contributes to ensuring that Switzerland is involved at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange concluded between the Commission and the associated institutions , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s Common Business Agreement with the date of entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland can become contractual partners of any agreement , whose aim is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the executive bodies responsible for carrying out the association provided in Article 2 of this Agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the association agreement .
&quot; in particular , the association agreement fores@@ ees the sub@@ stitution of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the commission and of the Council of the Federation . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research work and to ensure that best results can be achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG &quot; - represented .
&quot; VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with respect to all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the associated institutions and aims to establish their T * nific@@ ence in the interests of both contracting parties to the common objective in Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Procedure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Groups , which provide the VG Research proposals with regard to ensuring that the funds granted to the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task as regards all research and development work referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the directors of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , and who is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , will carry out this task with respect to all research and development activities that fall under the present agreement . &quot;

the BIS may conclude Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when the banks make an appropriate application .
&quot; the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor state to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor state , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ ices ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to whose application the BIS would be ready . &quot;
&quot; in each stand@@ by credit , BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of leng@@ th@@ ening continu@@ ances without having been exceeded for a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans and the possible extension , BI@@ Z would charge a credit @-@ opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first connections will not be made before the end of one month after the conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the dra@@ fts would take place in the currencies available at the BIS , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be taking into account the funds of the bank , presum@@ ably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who applied the BIS at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with mam@@ mot@@ h and lamb meat
&quot; I honor me to take reference to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or frozen mam@@ mot@@ h - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the actual quantity of the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change in the offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community is entitled to the protective clause , it is obliged to bear in mind that the access to Argentina for the communal market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ ture of 10 V. ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the quantity prescribed under number 2 according to the Argent@@ inian trade extent with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; here , the VAT rate stipulated under number 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity stated under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the Community on 23 000 tons of slaughter body weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community applies precau@@ tions to prevent the sales of frozen meat on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of reimbur@@ sements or other promotion measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb , shall only be considered for prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a manner which is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the Interpretation and Application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that within the quantities specified in this agreement , the quantities are granted for the products named under the number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in its turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina will be made dependent on the presentation of a export licence , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for issu@@ ance of the import license cannot be wai@@ ved for the products in question .
&quot; in addition , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals will be notified of the quantities given for export lic@@ ences ; these data may , if applicable , be en@@ code according to the identification country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly works .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including conditions that are important for the purpose mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat under the agreement shall not be carried out under the agreement . &quot;
the Committee addresses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be without preju@@ dice to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount stated under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 May .
&quot; the amount is determined by the entry into force of this agreement until 1st January of the following year , and will take account of the seasonal character of trade . &quot;

&quot; recogni@@ zing the fact that the sheep @-@ industry and the export of hammer and lamb meat after the world market and in particular after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s hammer and lamb are not affected on these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or frozen mam@@ mot@@ h - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand will ensure for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of its H@@ amm@@ el - and Lamb @-@ meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand under@@ takes to ensure proper procedures that the actual quantity of the annual quantity does not exceed the set quantity . &quot;
the pre @-@ set quantities are carried out in traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the association ass@@ ures that New Zealand will not be hin@@ dered by this agreement to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position in the community market .

the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly works .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the hammer , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including conditions that are important for clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out under the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee discusses all the questions arising during the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement apply without preju@@ dice to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual quantity prescribed in clause 2 applies for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount observed from the entry into force of this agreement until 1st January of the following year is set in proportion to the total amount of the year .

human thorou@@ gh@@ bred may only be shipped in containers in which the temperature can be kept at 4 C to 6 C throughout the transport .
&quot; the preparations and devices mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be ster@@ ile , ap@@ y@@ rogen and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the equipment necessary to inf@@ usion , as well as the solvents for dry preparations . &quot;
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is taken by a healthy person and mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; C ) which are not free from diseases of blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; the blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ d through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle , into which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was fu@@ elled before sterili@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; after the removal of the blood sample , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantit@@ atively , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution must not be more than 220 ml per litre human whole blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should not exceed 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system has previously been determined by the blood cells and ser@@ um ; determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of don@@ or blood .
&quot; if there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot;

&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which most of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been gained ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution which was added to the removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rine ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all procedures required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , which must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so on the label also its volume and composition is to be given . &quot;
&quot; the human dry @-@ plasma is obtained by drying out the liquid , which is depos@@ ited at the top with centri@@ fu@@ g@@ ation or sedi@@ mentation of human whole blood . &quot;
human dry @-@ plasma is obtained by cold @-@ drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the quantity of liquid obtained from the production of the substance . &quot;
the protein concentration of the solution thus obtained may not be less than 45 g. per litre and the solution must not exhibit visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which a hazardous content of is@@ oh@@ em@@ ol@@ ys@@ ine or immune hem@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ins have been determined ( using a fresh blood sample ) are to be excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours of the blood sample , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood supply of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effect of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations , signs of bacterial contamination , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation has to be proven in a blood supply of at least 10 ml . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination has to react with all blood samples tested which contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly th@@ inner of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest of ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely in volume of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carrier , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ suff@@ erer which is observed in a series of di@@ lution with er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ und@@ ations .
the ti@@ ter shows the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for the International standard preparations present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as non @-@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties are to be kept for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which it has been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 B.C. of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ ption do@@ xy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent national authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent further increases the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml flu@@ essi@@ vely or re @-@ dissolved Ser@@ um .
&quot; re@@ agents , in@@ different whether in a fluid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents used for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be d@@ yed arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an International Convention has come about through a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are spread in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative con@@ tro@@ ll blood cells . &quot;
the amount required in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy test described in this protocol .
the producer laboratory has to carry out written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents have to be kept from the laboratory for a long time , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container you can attach a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the amount or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing , &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen C of the R@@ h system . &quot;
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ds of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; therefore , these ser@@ a are only specific for the C @-@ tigen only when the blood cells tested are infl@@ ated in a 0.9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C ser@@ a , which is intended for use on object carrier according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the tigen @-@ system of the R@@ h system . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carrier according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and must not be contained in any form Anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time among the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carrier according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be lower with all types of red blood cells that show a reaction . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the A group . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that do not contain A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison form , separately with floo@@ ds of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood type B. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells which do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is , in parallel with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison form , with a flow of blood cells of group B to ti@@ tr@@ ate ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent pre @-@ floo@@ ding of B blood cells , it must occur if the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by inj@@ ections of human ser@@ um proteins .
&quot; it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , thus ag@@ glut@@ inated it no un@@ laden human red blood cells , in@@ different to which blood group they belong . &quot;

&quot; in THE ER@@ WA@@ EC@@ TION that the Community adopted a unified administration paper within the action programme to strengthen the internal market , &quot;
&quot; in THE ER@@ WA@@ EC@@ TION that it is appropriate to simplify the recei@@ v@@ ables in the goods traffic between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , and between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a single management paper , &quot;
&quot; in THE ER@@ WA@@ Y , that this agreement must not be interpreted in a way that it un@@ ites the contracting parties from their obligations from other international agreements . &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the recei@@ v@@ ables in the goods traffic between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a unified management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as single paper ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method between the contracting parties ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
the recep@@ tions associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single paper to use for the pr@@ intings according to the samples in Annex I to this Convention .
&quot; depending on the case , the single paper will be used for export , shipping , or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out explicitly required legislation applicable to the contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in any use of the single paper ; &quot;
&quot; - must be requested by the parties , so that they may come to the enjoyment of a reserve or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Agreement does not hin@@ der the parties to use simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further fac@@ ilitation of the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In particular , simplified procedures can be seen in particular that the goods in question are not to be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; further the submission of an incomplete application may be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , a registration must subsequently be filed , with the consent of the competent authorities in order to have a peri@@ odic collective registration to be submitted within the deadline specified by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trade paper instead of the single paper . &quot;

amend@@ ment to the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods ( happening to Brussels on 24 June 1986 )
the Parties to the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a council for cooperation in the field of customs clearance
&quot; it is desirable that on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE EX@@ EC@@ TION that without a change in Article 13 of the Convention , the date of entry into force of this Convention would remain uns@@ afe - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods , referred to in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , paragraph 1 is given the following version : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention shall enter into force at least three months after the exp@@ iry of at least three months , at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ tions signed in Article 11 , or have depos@@ ited their rati@@ fication or accession documents , but not before 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; A. This Protocol takes effect at the same time with the Convention in force , provided that at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ tions signed in Article 11 of the Convention on the adoption of the Protocol to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council for Cooperation in the territory of customs . &quot;
&quot; however , only states or customs or economic uni@@ ones can post@@ p@@ one the document of the adoption of this protocol which previously signed the Agreement without reservation of rati@@ fication or at the same time under@@ scor@@ ing or depos@@ iting its certificate of rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B . every State and any Cust@@ oms or Economic Union , the contracting party of the Convention on the entry into force of this protocol according to paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version . &quot;
&quot; a plant that is indispensable not only for the entertainment and conservation of soil , but also allows the exploitation of land , which makes no other pl@@ anting , and even with extensive farming , which constitutes the main part of today &apos;s production , is favourable to any improvement of the cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS that from its cultivation it will depend on the existence and living standards of millions of families who , in turn , are wholly dependent on the measures aimed at maintaining and expanding the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
with regard to the fact that olive oil and Taf@@ el@@ oli@@ ven are essential ingredients in the areas in which the olive cultivation is common ;
&quot; with regard to the fact that the essential characteristic of olive production is the in@@ convenience of harvesting and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as very different producers of producers ; &quot;
